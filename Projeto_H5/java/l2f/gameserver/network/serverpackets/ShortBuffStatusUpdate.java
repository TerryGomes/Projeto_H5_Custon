	 * This is client's row 2 buff packet.

	 * F4 CD 04 00 00 07 00 00 00 0F 00 00 00 - overlord's healing, panel2
	 *
	 * structure cddd
	 *
	 * NOTES:
	 * 1). hex converting:
	 * Skill 1229 is in hex 4CD, but in packet it is CD 04 00 00.
	 * So i think that we must read the skill's hex id form behind ^^
	 * 2). multipe skills on row 2:
	 * i don't know what more skills can go at row2 @ offie.
	 * please contact me to test it. Currently packet is working for one skill.
	 * 3). Removing buff icon
	 * must be sended empty packet
	 * F4 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
	 * to remove buff icon. Or it will be lasted forever.
