!Jack Sage:

All you need to do is work harder on the things that you have done up to now. *Train more, become stronger*, and stretch your limits! Soon a great danger will threaten the world. We are in dire need of talented adventurers who are prepared to fight! I recommend you take the Gift of Vitality and go hunting!
