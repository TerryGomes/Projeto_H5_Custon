Lakfi-Lakfi:
Lucky! Thank you. You are so kind! In gratitude, I will tell you my secret! If I eat a lot of adena, I'll increase my weight. And then my wings will disappear.

And if someone attacks me at that moment , then <font color="LEVEL"> he can easily pick up my treasure. </ Font> Shh! Don't tell anyone about it. I believe that you will not tell anyone!
