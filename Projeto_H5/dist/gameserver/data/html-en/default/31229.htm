!Event Manager Winnie the Cat:

Meow! Greetings! I'm Winnie the Cat!
Our master, Collector Bashtal, formerly of the Bronze Key guild, has asked us  to collect medals that were scattered throughout the world. We've come to this village as his personal emmissaries!
We're organizing a *Medal Collecting Event*! Would you like to participate? Collect medals and take them to Roy the Cat over there!
There's so much to do, but I need a nap!! Meow!!
