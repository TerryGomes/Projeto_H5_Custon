!Officer Tepios:

Welcome to the Seed of Infinity. My name is Officer Tepios. My role is to build temporary shelters and guide newcomers around here.

This is the place we call the *Death Gate*. Many soldiers and unnamed adventurers have gone to their deaths through this entrance.

However, we must continue to venture through it to face our enemies. It is our fate, I suppose. If you would help us, we will reward you on behalf of Admiral Keucereus.
