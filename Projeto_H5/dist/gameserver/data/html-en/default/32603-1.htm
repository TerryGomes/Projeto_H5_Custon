!Officer Tepios:

*The Seed of Infinity* is an infernal region ruled by Shilen's disciple, the undead fiend *Ekimus*. We know little about him, unfortunately.

But I can you something about this region itself. Here *space itself is organically linked together like some vast living organism*. Just as your whole body is affected if you injure one part, so the Seed of Infinity's overall power decreases as we slay monsters in this region.

But if you are killed within, then your soul will feed and strengthen the power of the entire Seed.

That is why it is so important that *only parties of skilled adventurers be admitted to the Seed of Infinity*.
