!Heart of Warding:

You are overcome by a voice, a voice so powerful you are helpless as it speaks:

<font color="LEVEL">A terrible creature%%
fell to the earth from above%%
in order to vent a mother's spite,%%
cursed and forsaken by her own children.%%
Dark Pilgrim of the Holy Land,%%
Do you dare face the Land Dragon Antharas?</font>

(A maximum of 200 people can challenge Antharas.)
