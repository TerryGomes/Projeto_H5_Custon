!Gatekeeper of the Abyss:

You sense an icy cold gaze fixed on you from a gigantic structure that seems somehow not quite alive nor dead. You must pass its judgment to enter the *heart of the Seed of Infinity*; if you wish to avoid it, you will be expelled *outside the Seed of Infinity*. However, the gaze isn't as painful as you feared. Has something happened to Ekimus?

[npc_%objectId%_request_permission|Withstand the gaze.]
