!Destroyed Tumor:

As soon as the reddish-brown liquid that fills the passage touches a body, it causes sharp, terrible pain.

To move through this passage safely, you must use 3 <font color="LEVEL">Tears of Freed Soul</font>, which contain all the victims' anger against Ekimus.

(If the initiating PC possesses 3 Tears of Freed Soul, the entire party can move.)

[npc_%objectId%_reenterechmus|Use the Tears of Freed Souls as protection and move through the passage.]
