!Priest Kanis:

I am Priest Kanis, and I serve the great Shamaness Parme of the Crystal Oracle, who offered herself as a sacrifice in order to appease the Water Dragon Fafurion.

Several days ago, Demons, crazed sevants of the Water Dragon and Crystal Golems attacked the Oracle.

It was completely destroyed, and the people of the Oracle were killed or captured.

Only I was able to escape to seek help...
