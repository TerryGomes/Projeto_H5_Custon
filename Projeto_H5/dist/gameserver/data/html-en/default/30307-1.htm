Needless to say, in order to make a Dualsword, you first need two swords.

They can be either Superior weapons, Common weapons or Masterwork weapons.

Superior weapons can only be combined with other Superior weapons, Common weapons can only be combined with other Common weapons, and Masterwork weapons can only be combined with other Masterwork weapons. Additionally, a Masterwork Dualsword can be made only using swords above B grade.

Since I must make a living, I do charge a small fee. And since a fire is needed and the cost of fuel is so high...

Hmm... As you probably know, it's extremely difficult to handle a Dualsword without training and coordination.

This is also why only the same grade swords can be combined.

I can combine swords up to grade C. If you want something better, you'd better go to a bigger city.

Remember as well that an Enchanted weapon loses its effect once it is combined with another. Don't forget!

Oh, one more thing. If you invest some kind of a skill in a weapon, it won't work. I'm afraid that it simply can't be combined with another.

Perhaps I've told you too much? I hope your head isn't swimming with all this information!

Now then, please select the type of sword you wish me to craft!
