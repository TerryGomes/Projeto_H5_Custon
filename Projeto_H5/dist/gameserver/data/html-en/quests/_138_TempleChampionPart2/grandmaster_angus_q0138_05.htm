<html><body>Grand Master Angus:<br>
You have returned with all of this belongings!<br1>
Shilen be praised!<br>
Thanks to your help, we will be able to send the soul of the dead Dark Elven trainee to rest with Shilen.<br>
We are in your debt.<br>
I will write you a letter of recommendation so that others of my faith will not treat you like one of those arrogant priests of the Temple of Einhasad.
