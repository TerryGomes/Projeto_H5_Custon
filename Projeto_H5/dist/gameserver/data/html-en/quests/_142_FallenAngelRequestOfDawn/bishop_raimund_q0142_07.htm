<html><body>High Priest Raymond:<br>
Well done! Well done indeed!<br>
You have served Einhasad well by forever silencing the blasphemous tongue of this sad, fallen creature.<br>
That fallen angel -- no, devil is a better word -- might have led many astray if he had not been stopped.<br>
You have done a great service for both our order and the people of this land.
