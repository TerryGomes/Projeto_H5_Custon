It is said that Enira the Banshee Queen is a subordinate of Ekimus, the ruler of the Seed of Infinity. But I believe differently. It seems as though she is keeping an eye on the Seed of Infinity.<br>
Of course, I'm not saying Enira is on our side. She is still very much a threat. If we hope to travel the skies of Gracia unmolested, she must be defeated. I have marked the areas where she frequently appears on your map.
