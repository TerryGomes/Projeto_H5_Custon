<br>Ah! You wish to have a Dualsword made? That is our specialty! In fact, we can make every type of Dualsword except the A-grade!

If there's anyone better than us, it could only be the legendary *Blacksmith of Mammon*! 

You don't have to bring me a stamp, either. 

Just bring me the swords you want combined as well as Stones of Purity as a fee.

Make sure the swords are either Regular, Standard or Rare.

Regular weapons must be combined with other Regular weapons, Standard weapons must be combined with other Standard weapons, and Rare weapons must be combined with other Rare weapons. A Rare Dualsword can only be made using swords above grade B, which is the lowest grade we work with.

Remember that if you invest some kind of a skill in a weapon, you can't combine it with another.

Remember as well that an Enchanted weapon loses its effect once it is combined with another.

Which Dualsword would you like? Select one now.
