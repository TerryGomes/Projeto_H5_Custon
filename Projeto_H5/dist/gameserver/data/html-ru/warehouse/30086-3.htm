<tr><td>Our "Iron Gate" guild has came up with an amazing stuff after months of research. It's called "Wondrous Cubic". This item can make various types of "Cube Fragments".
However, this item can only be used once a day, which has made it somewhat difficult to collect the fragments. How about it? If you bring the cubic fragments to me, I will exchange them for various scrolls and items. If you don't have a Wondrous Cubic, go see Helvetia in Giran village. She will tell you how to get it.
Oh, and I heard that valuable jewels sometimes fall from the Wondrous Cubic occassionally! Of course, these rumors are just that, for now...
(The Wondrous Cubics can be used everyday from 6:30 am.)</td></tr>
