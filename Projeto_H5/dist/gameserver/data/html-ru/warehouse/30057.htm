Warehouse Keeper Aldo:

Looks like you're ready for a trip! Hey, you're not planning on taking all that baggage with you, are you? Let me give you some free advice: take only what you really need and store the rest. As it so happens, we at the Iron Gate Guild would be happy to safeguard your items until you or someone you designate comes back to claim them.

In fact, you can actually deposit the items here and withdraw them in any city. How's that for service?
