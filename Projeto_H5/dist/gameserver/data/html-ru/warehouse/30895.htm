Warehouse Keeper Kluck:

Welcome, adventurer, welcome to the Heine Steel Gate Guild! Do you wish to deposit an item? Or perhaps you wish to make a withdrawal? No? Perhaps you wish to send goods to another city? Or learn a skill? With all the options we offer, I scarcely have time to think, much less eat! That's the price of success, eh?
