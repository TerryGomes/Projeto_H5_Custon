Warehouse Keeper Marty:

If you think delivering an item might be dangerous, why don't you use our warehouse? We are Dwarven traders, after all -- experts in the warehouse and banking business across the continent. Use our service and you can deposit or receive your item anywhere!

As you see, our headquarters are here in the Ivory Tower, safely beyond the reach of greedy nobles or ambitious adventurers.
