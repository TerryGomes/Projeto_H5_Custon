Warehouse Keeper Airy:

Hey, come on in! Do you want to deposit an item? Or do you have other business with me? I'm tired, so let's cut to the chase. Oh, I should mention that you'll need to pay in advance if you want to deposit something. Don't trouble yourself with those heavy things -- just leave them here with us and we'll keep them safely...
