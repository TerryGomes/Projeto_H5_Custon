Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Did you get something nice? Be careful, though: in this area, there are some creatures that look just like the others but are actually much more powerful. They are called "elders." Don't confront them unless you're fully ready. Remember the old saying, "The older ginger becomes, the hotter it gets." Don't say you weren't warned!
