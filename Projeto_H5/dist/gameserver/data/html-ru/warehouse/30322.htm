Warehouse Keeper Ballin:

Welcome, youngster. You seem to be doing very well for yourself. Ever consider depositing some of your items instead of carrying them around like that man over there? He looks like a peddler! No, clearly we offer a better, safer alternative here at the Steel Gate Guild.

And once you deposit an item, you can withdraw it at any of our branches! For the sake of security, of course, only the people you designate can do so.
