Warehouse Keeper Radic:

Hello, adventurer. Welcome to the Ivory Tower! I recommend that you deposit your items here and have a look around. You are in the 1st basement, where you will find various guilds for wizards and magi. This place is literally a village built for wizards by wizards. 

During the reign of the Elmoreden Empire, the Tower's influence rivaled even that of the emperor...
