Tejakar Ketra! Welcome, comrade! I'm a supplier of specialty items! The elder tells me that you're interested in buying something!

How about this low-level booty pouch? Someday, when you're qualified to open it, you'll have the strongest armor available!

Bring me a *Buffalo Horn* and I'll give you whatever you want! What would you like?
