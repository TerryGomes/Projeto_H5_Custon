!Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:

Behold the promised land of the Varka! It was given to us as a reward for spilling our blood in defense of the kingdom of Elmore! Who do those pathetic Ketra Orcs think they are? Saying that this land has belonged to them for thousands of years! Rubbish!

You, traveler of the west wind! Will you help us defeat those arrogant Ketras? You'll be well-rewarded!
