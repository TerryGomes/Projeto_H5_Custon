!Trader Shikon:

Greetings, friend of the Varka!

Are you surprised to learn that traders such as myself exist within my warrior race? Don't you realize that rivers carry the treasures of many lands as they find their way to the sea?

What I can supply to you now is this low-level booty pouch! Someday, when you can open one of our looted boxes, you'll lay your hands on the strongest armor available!

Bring me a *Nepenthes Seed* and I'll give you whatever you want!
