!Hierarch Kadun Zu Ketra:

We Ketras have come here to reclaim the land of our ancestors! We've discovered that the Varka Silenos, our loathsome enemy, defile this holy land! We will never forgive them this insult!

Help us return to our homeland! May the flame of Paagrio burn within your heart eternally!

But, be careful! You must remember our brothers are always watching you. *As soon as you lay a hand on our Ketra tribe, all the promises between you and us will disappear!*
