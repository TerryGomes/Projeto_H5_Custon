!Mercenary Supplier Abercrombie:

Everyone's talking about the excellence you showed in battle again today! You're winning all the bonuses! Ha! It's good to see someone succeed in this godforsaken place!

Now tell me! Is there anything in particular you want? Although only a few types of supplies are available, I'll see what I can do. By the way, you prepared a chit didn't you?
