!Mercenary Medic Selina:

Listen up! Your bravery is admirable, but you must take better care of yourself! I actually felt sorry for you when you came in so mangled!

But don't get me wrong, you did a great job! You really raised morale around here! I'd like to offer you some magical assistance. Let me know if you need anything.
