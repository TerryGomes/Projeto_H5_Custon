!Soul Guide Udan Mardui:

I'm Soul Guide Udan Mardui.

You're a friend of Varka, aren't you? Your reputation precedes you, my friend! Unfortunately, I can't offer you any just help yet.

All favors must be reciprocated with an appropriate price! When you've accumulated enough trust, come back and see me again! On behalf of our tribe, I'll give you a reward!
