<br>Ah, so you wish to enhance your weapon! Well, it's the next-best thing to buying a new one, I say... But remember, a higher price doesn't necessarily mean a better product. There are many excellent weapons that are reasonably priced.

As I'm sure you know, capabilities added to your weapon don't interfere with enchantments.

Oh, I must tell you, I can't handle A-Grade weapons. For those you'll need to find the legendary *Blacksmith of Mammon*, a giant among blacksmiths! He may be able to do it.

Also... when you want to *remove* special capabilities from your weapon, the *Trader of Mammon* can help you...  By the way, I heard a rumor that the *Black Marketeer of Mammon* has learned the technique of removing special capabilities from weapons from the Trader of Mammon.

I'll bet you already knew that, too, didn't you?

Choose the capabilities you wish to add to your weapons!<br><br>
