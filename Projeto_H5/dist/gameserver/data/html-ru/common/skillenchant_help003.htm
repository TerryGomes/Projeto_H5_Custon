There are several Skill Enchanting options at your disposal: General Skill Enchant, Blessed Skill Enchant, Skill Un-Enchanting and Skill Route Change.

<center><font color="LEVEL">General Skill Enchanting</font></center>%%
This method of enchanting requires 1 [Giant's Codex] and a certain amount of SP and adena to complete. If the enchant attempt fails, then the skill enchant level is returned to zero.

<center><font color="LEVEL">Blessed Skill Enchanting</font></center>

This is a safer way to enchant a skill. This method requires 1 *Giant's Codex: Mastery* and 5 times the SP and adena of a general skill enchant. But, should you fail to enchant the skill, the value is not reset to zero. This option is good for higher level enchants.

<center><font color="LEVEL">Skill Un-Enchanting</font></center>

This option refunds the user with some of the SP originally spent on the skill. This method requires 1 *Giant's Codex: Oblivion*, and takes the skill enchant down one level at a time. 80% of the original SP spent on the skill will be refunded to you. And if used when the skill is at level 1, the skill will be reset to zero.

<center><font color="LEVEL">Skill Route Change</font></center>

This feature changes the type of enchant applied to the skill. In addition to the *Giant's Codex: Discipline*, the SP and adena required to change the route is 20% of the SP and adena needed for the next level of the enchant. When used, there is a chance that the enchant level may stay the same or may be reduced by 1-3 levels.
