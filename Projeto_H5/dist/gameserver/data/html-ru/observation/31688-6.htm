!Grand Olympiad Manager:

Grand Olympiad points are needed to become a Hero. The person who earns the most points in each class will be the Hero of the era. Also, if you earn more than a certain number of Grand Olympiad points, you will be rewarded with the Noblesse Gate Pass regardless of whether you are a Hero or not.
