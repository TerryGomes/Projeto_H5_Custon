Gatekeeper Bella:

Here in Gludio there is an *Airship Dock* for Airships heading to Gracia.

Gracia is surrounded by a powerful magic force field, so it's impossible to enter it via teleportation or by sea. Only Airships made in Gracia are able to safely travel between the two continents.

A dock made from floating stones was constructed nearby; it took years of work, believe me. Boarding is conducted through the *Airship Controller*.

The only way to journey to the Gracia Continent is to use this dock. If you wish, I can teleport you there now.
