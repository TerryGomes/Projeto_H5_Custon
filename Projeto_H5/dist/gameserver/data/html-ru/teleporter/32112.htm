Gariachin:

Welcome! I am Gariachin. I am entrusted with the teleportation of visitors to this island. It may sound strange to you, but I've come to love this island and respect its people. It is a precious place, housing the hope, wisdom and future of the Elroki tribe.

I will transport you to the southern beach of the Primeval plains. If you have the chance, will you send my regards to my friend, Orahochin?
