!Gracia Survivor:

I understand. But Gracia is not a place to be taken lightly. Given your inexperience, even if you go there you would only be a liability to the war effort.

Aden also has many monsters and the need for adventurers to fight them. Build your skills here, then go to Gracia.

(It is recommended that only characters who are level 75 or higher travel to Gracia.)
