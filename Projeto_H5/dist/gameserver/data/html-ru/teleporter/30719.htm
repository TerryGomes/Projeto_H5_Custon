Gatekeeper Mariell:

Hi there. The Dark Elf Guild is located on the 4th floor, the Elves of Light are on the 3rd, and the Human Mystics are downstairs. With a history stained by blood, don't you think it is encouraging to see the different races gathered in a small tower like this?

Now, what can I do for you?
