Gracia Survivor:

Do you know of the continent of Gracia? It is located far across the sea from Aden; its land is barren and its climate is rough. Despite these challenges -- or perhaps because of them -- it was the home of a strong, hardy people.

But now all has changed... Strange Seeds appeared throughout the continent, spawning *Pagan Monsters* who wreaked havoc on the land. Although we fought under the command of King Keucereus, we were outmatched. Gracia fell under the sway of that great evil.

Fortunately, a few survivors were able to reach Aden and ask for help. There your clan leaders promised to send assistance. Since then, our soldiers have formed a combined force under the command of King Keucereus, waiting for our chance to exact vengeance on those who destroyed our homes. A few of my comrades stayed behind in Aden to appeal to other adventurers for help.
