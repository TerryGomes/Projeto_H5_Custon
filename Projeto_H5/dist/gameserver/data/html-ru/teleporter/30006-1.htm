Gatekeeper Roxxy:

The Airship Field is where Airships heading to and from *Gracia* dock. A powerful magic force field prevents entry to Gracia from sea or via teleportation.

But Gracian-made Airships can travel safely through the force field. It is still a dangerous journey, though!

After several years of work, a wharf was constructed from magical stones capable of floating in mid-air. You can board one of the Airships using an *Airship Controller*.

If you wish to visit Gracia, this is the only way. I can teleport you to the wharf if you wish.
