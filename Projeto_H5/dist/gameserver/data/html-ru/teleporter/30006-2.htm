Gatekeeper Roxxy:

The Ivory Tower is the foremost temple of all Mystics. It has been well known as such ever since the age of Elmoreden. I was born here, and graduated from Einhovant's School of Wizardry. And now, I am working as a gatekeeper by the order of the Ivory Tower. If you happen to go to the Ivory Tower later on, please give my best regards to Grand Magister Valerie. She is my teacher and a wonderful, caring person.
