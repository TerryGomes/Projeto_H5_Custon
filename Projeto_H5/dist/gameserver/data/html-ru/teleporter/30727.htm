Gatekeeper Verona:

Greetings, seeker of knowledge! Welcome to the Ivory Tower, that venerable repository of mystical secrets. I am Verona, Gatekeeper of the Tower.

The Ivory Tower consists of several floors, each of which is completely separated from the others. To travel from one floor to another, you must use the services of a gatekeeper like myself.

You are currently standing in the first floor lobby. There is a shopping center in the basement, the Human Wizard Guild is on level 2, the Elven Wizard Guild is on level 3, and the Dark Wizard Guild is on level 4. Where do you wish to go?
