Event Gatekeeper:

Who seeks the Throne of Chaos at the dawn of this new era?

Well, I thought I'd try a more dramatic greeting once, just for kicks. I did hear a rumor about a new era, you know.

Anyway, I'm the event gatekeeper. I appear for the teleport event every time there's a new update!

During the teleport event period, I can teleport you to the nearby hunting ground at a much cheaper fee than normal!

Come see me often during the event period!
