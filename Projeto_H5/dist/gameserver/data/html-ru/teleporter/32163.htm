Gatekeeper Ragara:

Ages ago, the Kamael were barred from using teleportation magic. Needless to say, this has put us at a distinct disadvantage. Finally, we learned how to borrow other races' power.

The Wizards of the Ivory Tower sympathized with us, so they created the Staff of Transferring and built strongholds everywhere. Beginning adventurers may move freely to strongholds as a result.
