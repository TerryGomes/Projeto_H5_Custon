Separated Soul:

The Claw of Antharas barely touched my face, but my soul was still ripped apart like this.

I can't gather the scattered souls in the area, but I can sense them. I could send you to the location of the souls, but you don't look capable yet of combining my ripped soul.

(Moving to the location of the other separated souls requires the character to be at *level 80 or above*.)
