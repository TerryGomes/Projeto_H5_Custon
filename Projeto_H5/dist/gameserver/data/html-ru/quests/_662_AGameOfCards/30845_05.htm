!Warehouse Chief Klump:

It's very simple. There are 70 cards, made up of 5 suits with 14 characters in each suit. You can draw 5 cards from the lot, and if you get one of the combination of cards below, you can be rewarded.

Five of a kind: Five cards containing the same character.%%
Four of a kind: Four cards containing the same character.%%
Full house: Three cards with the same character along with two cards with the same character.%%
Three of a kind: Three cards with the same character.%%
Two pairs: Two pairs of cards with the same characters in each pair.%%
One pair: Two cards with the same charater.

If you don't have any of the hands I just mentioned, it's called having "no pair", and you don't get anything. Of course, a five of a kind is rare, so the reward for getting it is high; on the other hand, one pair is the easiest hand to get, so you'll receive only the lowest reward.
