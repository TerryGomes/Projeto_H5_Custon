!Beast Herder Tunatun:

Everyone knows that the best meat can only be found from the animals on this land. I’ve done all I can to keep them safe, but these Sel Mahum <font color="LEVEL">Farm Ravagers and Farm Bandits</font> are starting to be too much for me. In fact, I would be overwhelmed if they all attacked at once. There wouldn’t be anything I could do to protect my life’s work.

When everything a man knows is threatened... how can he find his peace?
