!Guard Belton:

You've come back empty-handed. Did you not promise to bring me harpy's *Silver Feathers, the teeth of a wyrm* and the *venom of a medusa*?

As soon as you obtain these three materials, bring them to me. I will reward you for each that you bring back. I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so don't worry about the reward.  Please don't quit, help me.
