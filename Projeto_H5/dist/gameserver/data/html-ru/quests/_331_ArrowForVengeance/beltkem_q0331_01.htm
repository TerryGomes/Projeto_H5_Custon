!Guard Beltkam:

My family all lost their lives to *Antharas the Land Dragon.* My mother and younger sister perished ten years ago, when many southern villages in Giran burned to the ground in the heat of Antharas' rampage. Then, three years ago, when the land dragon extermination force was formed at the lord's command, my father and older brother were recruited as soldiers, sent to the Dragon Valley, and eventually died meaningless deaths.

I swore an oath before my family graves that I would slay that great evil creature. Everyone holds me back, saying that it is a futile effort, but I will definitely bring Antharas down. It's the only way I know to bring peace to my family's spirits.

I have prepared diligently during this past year for my revenge. I consulted with many mercenaries, and I even researched documents relating to the dragon in the Ivory Tower's library. The dwarf bounty hunter "Terrin Wymslayer," who is a famous dragon hunter, especially gave me many words of advice. I finally came to the conclusion that *arrows* were the most effective weapons.

Now, then. I do not mind telling you of my troubles, but I cannot ask you to help me in this endeavor, at least not as you are now. One day, perhaps, I may be in your debt.
