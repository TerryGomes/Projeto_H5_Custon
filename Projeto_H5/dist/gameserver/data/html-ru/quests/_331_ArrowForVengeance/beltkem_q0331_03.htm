!Guard Belton:

I am not foolish enough to think that I can avenge the death of my family alone. I have received the aid of many, and will continue to ask favors of those like yourself.

The materials you must find for me are the *Silver Feathers of a Harpy, Wyrm Teeth* and the *venom from a Medusa*. The Harpy's Feathers are used to make the fletching for the arrows, while the Wyrm Teeth will be used for arrowheads. They say that if one applies the venomous poison of the Medusa on the tip of the arrow and dries it properly, the poison will retain its effects for many years.

As soon as you have obtained these three materials, bring them to me, for I will give you a reward for each. I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so be confident that your reward will be grand. I have no use material things as avenging my family is all I know now.
