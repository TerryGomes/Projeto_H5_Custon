!Head Summoner Radyss:

When you responded to the third tablet, you sensed the location of the next Stone of Commune, didn't you? At that time, you should have seen me. I also felt your existence...!%%
Hack... What you sensed is this small piece of stone. This is the fragment of the fourth Stone of Commune. However, you must find the other part and combine them in order to form a working Stone of Commune.%%
The rest of the Stone of Commune is called "Divine Stone of Wisdom" and worshipped as an idol by the barbarians in this area. According to what I've learned, the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos tribes enshrine the stone. To get this stone, you must gain their trust. Hack... However, it will never be easy, because they are wild and warlike tribes. Which tribe will you choose to approach?
