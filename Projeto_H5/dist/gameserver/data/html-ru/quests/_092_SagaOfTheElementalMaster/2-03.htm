!Head Summoner:

Hack! Cough... Oh, you brought the medicine... Did it buy me more time...? This medicine... will ease my pain for the moment...%%
Now, I will tell you about the tablet pilgrimage, the trial you must pass to be an Elemental Master. Young leaf, listen to what I say from now on...%%
Even Elves like us cannot read the passage written on the Tablet of Vision. The gods don't want us to learn the highest level of magic. It's because we, the creatures would become arrogant and self-righteous too easily. They are afraid that a situation, such as when the Giants made war against them, might occur again.%%
So, they broke the tablet, where the most profound principles of Magic were written (it should be used when teaching magic to the Elves like us), into six pieces and changed the letters on the tablet into the Gods' characters. The Gods' characters cannot be understood with the intelligence of creatures like us... But, I by chance found out how to read the characters on the six tablets!
