!Prefect Brukurse:

Tejakar Oroka! Young Orc, go to the wilderness right now and kill those *maraku wolfmen* without mercy! Collect forty of their severed heads and bring them back to me! The maraku tribe leaders are quite powerful so be careful when you deal with them!

I will pierce the heads of that proud race with spears, and display them outside the village! They will realize the high price of arousing our anger! Here! Go off and fight!
