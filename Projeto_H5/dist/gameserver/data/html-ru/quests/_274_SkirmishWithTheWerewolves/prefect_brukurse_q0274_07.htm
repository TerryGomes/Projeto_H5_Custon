!Prefect Brukurse:

This Immortal Plateau has been the holiest of lands for the Orcs since ancient times! The place where our progenitor -- made by the great Paagrio of flame -- took his first steps, is none other than the Immortal Plateau. However, there is a group of fools that refuses to understand that this land belongs to us. These wolfmen call themselves *maraku* and challenge us for our land.

The Paagrio Lord Kakai sent an envoy to the wolfmen and asked them to leave this land! But they replied to his civil request by returning the envoy's head! We will mercilessly punish those who repay our good will with blood!

I look at your eyes and I can tell that your blood is boiling with anger already! However, if you wish to fight for the dignity of your race, you must first be acknowledged as an Orc Fighter. *Go on to Praetorian Rukain and test your courage!*
