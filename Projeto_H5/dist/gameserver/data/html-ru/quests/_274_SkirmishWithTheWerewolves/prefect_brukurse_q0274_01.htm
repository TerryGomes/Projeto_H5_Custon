!Prefect Brukurse:

This Immortal Plateau has been the holiest land of the Orcs since ancient times! The place where our progenitor -- made by the great Paagrio of the flame -- took his first steps, is none other than the Immortal Plateau. However, there is a group of fools that will not understand that this land belongs to us. These wolfmen call themselves *maraku* and challenge us for our land.

The Paagrio Lord Kakai sent an envoy to the wolfmen and politely asked them to leave this land! But they replied to his civil request by returning the envoy's head! We will mercilessly punish those who repay our good will with blood! So, you should not go and prepare yourself for vengeance!
