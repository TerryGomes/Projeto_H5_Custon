!Seer Reva:

Humans so easily ignore the fact that the Tower of Insolence is like a gigantic tomb, erected at the expense of countless lives! To conceal the secret of the tower, the despot Baium executed thousands of slaves and buried them there. Their vengeful spirits haunt the tower to this day.

Hurry to the *Tower of Insolence*. There you will find the undead warriors who serve the Devil's Overlord. You must kill *Hallate's Warriors, Hallate's Knights and Hallate's Commanders*. Don't give an inch! Recover the *Ancient Ash Urns*! Bring back the ashes and I will perform the ritual of fire that will put the undead warriors to rest. If your work is deemed worthy in my eyes, I will bestow upon you a prize. Bring me 100 or more ash urns at once and you will receive an even greater prize!
