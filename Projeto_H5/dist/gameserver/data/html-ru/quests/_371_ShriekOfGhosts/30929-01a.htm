!Antique Dealer Patrin:

An appraisal determines the true value of an item! To the untrained eye, an antique piece like this one may seem rather ordinary. But to the experienced eye of an expert like myself, each subtle mark and worn surface tells a story. The materials and techniques used to create it become clear to me.

If the porcelain you bring me turns out to be a *famous* or a *high grade* porcelain, it will fetch a very high price at the store.

If the appraisal shows that the porcelain is *low grade* or *lowest grade*, it becomes practically worthless! Such items are better left unappraised.
