The Seed of Destruction, located to the west of my Alliance Base, is ruled by <font color="LEVEL">Tiat</font>, Lord of the Dragonkin and a follower of Shilen.<br>
She is called the wife of the <font color="LEVEL">Dragon of Darkness</font>, and when she appeared here, the monsters in the region were transformed into the likeness of Dragonkin -- at least that's how my magicians explain it. As they gather, the Seed of Destruction grows in strength.<br>
To enter it, you must use a <font color="LEVEL">clan airship</font> or <font color="LEVEL">transformation magic</font>.<br>
Heed my advice: many of the dangers here will exceed the individual skills of even the strongest adventurer. If at all possible, you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party.<br>
Do you understand?<br>
