Deliver the <font color="LEVEL">letter of recommendation</font> I gave you to <font color="LEVEL">Sergeant Allenos</font> inside the Seed of Destruction. Then he'll give you a small reward and assign you an important mission.<br>
If you wish to move freely through the skies of Gracia, complete a simple mission assigned by <font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font>, a Dwarf located south of here. You can also purchase a Transformation Scroll from <font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> next to him.
