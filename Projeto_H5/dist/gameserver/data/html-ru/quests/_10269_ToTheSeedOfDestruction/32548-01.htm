You look like you're ready for action. If so, I have a mission for you.<br>
I'd like you to enter the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Destruction</font>. Since Dragonkin assumed power there, it has become a extremely violent and dangerous place. A skilled adventurer like you may do a great deal of good there.<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest _10269_ToTheSeedOfDestruction 32548-04.htm">"I'm ready."</a><br>
