This <font color="LEVEL">letter of recommendation</font> authorizes you to be active within the Seed of Destruction. It says an adventurer like you can be trusted to take care of yourself.<br>
Give this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Sergeant Allenos</font> inside the Seed of Destruction. Then he'll assign you an important mission.<br>
If you wish to move freely in Gracia, you must acquire a <font color="LEVEL">Flying Transformed Object</font>. You can do so by completing a simple mission assigned by <font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font>, a Dwarf located south of here. You can also purchase a Transformation Scroll from <font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> next to him. Now then, good luck and good hunting!
