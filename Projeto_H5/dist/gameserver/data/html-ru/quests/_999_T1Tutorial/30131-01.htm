Newbie Helper:

Welcome! Are you ready for a mission?

Have you seen the gremlins around here? They've stolen the precious blue gemstone!

*You must recover it from them!*

I'll tell you again how to kill the gremlins. Place your cursor over a gremlin and click the <font color="FF0000">left button</font>. The cursor will change to a sword. Click the <font color="FF0000">F2 key</font> to attack with *Wind Strike* magic.

Complete this mission and I'll reward you with useful items. Good luck!
