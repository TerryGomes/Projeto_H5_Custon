Did you forget what to do? Get a blue gem! *You must kill gremlins to get a blue gem.*

Kill, kill, kill the gremlins! Put your cursor over a gremlin and click the <font color="FF0000">left mouse button</font>. It turns into a knife. Left-click again to slice up the gremlin!<img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64>

Do it quick and I'll give you something cool.
