Go and get a blue gem! *Don't you remember? You've got to kill gremlins!*

As I said, move your cursor over a gremlin and click the <font color="FF0000">left mouse button</font>. This will transform the cursor into the shape of a knife. Click the left mouse button again to attack. <img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64>

Use *Soul Cry* magic before attacking. This will improve your chances greatly. To activate Soul Cry magic, press <font color="FF0000">F2 key</font>, and again to de-activate it.<table border=0><tr><td><img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img133" width=64 height=64></td><td><img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img17" width=64 height=64></td></tr></table>

Do this and you shall be well-rewarded. Good luck!
