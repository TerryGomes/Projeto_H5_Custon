Welcome! Are you ready for a mission?

Have you seen the gremlins around here? They've stolen the precious blue gemstone!

*You must recover it from them!*

Place your cursor over a gremlin and click the <font color="FF0000">left button</font>. The cursor will change to a sword. Click the left button again to attack.<img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img12" width=64 height=64>

Before striking, to enhance the strength of your attack, use *Soul Cry* magic by clicking the <font color="FF0000">F2 key</font>. Click it again to turn off the magic.<table border=0><tr><td><img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img133" width=64 height=64></td><td><img src="L2UI_CH3.tutorial_img17" width=64 height=64></td></tr></table>
