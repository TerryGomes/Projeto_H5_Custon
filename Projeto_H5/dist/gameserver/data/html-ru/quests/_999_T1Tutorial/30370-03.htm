Nerupa:

You have worked hard to learn basic control of the game. From now on, though, you can really enjoy your adventures.

Here, take this gift. Did you already hear the explanation about how to use it?

Now you have a choice to make. Will you develop your skills further in the *Elven Village*? Or will you test your abilities by going to the Isle of Souls like the Kamael race? Think it over and tell me your decision.
