!Fishermen's Guild Member Lanosco:

Thanks for your help. I can't get around to get the materials I need like I used to... 
Now I'll make the *bait of wind* for you. I use the repulsive power between the elements of water and wind. 
Just as water and air don't mix, things that are underwater begin to float.

Now, give me the *100 essences of wind*!
