!Apprentice Atra:

The Mucrokians stimulate the contamination of this region. And for that reason, they must be exterminated.

Hunt down *Mucrokian Fanatics, Mucrokian Ascetics, Mucrokian Saviors, Mucrokian Preachers and Awakened Mucrokians*.
 Tear off the hide of each one you kill. Amidst their ranks you will also find *Contaminated Mucrokians*. For each of these that you kill, you will be able to salvage two hides.

Collect as many as you can, and return to me. If you've brought enough, I will exchange them for Dynasty accessory recipes.
