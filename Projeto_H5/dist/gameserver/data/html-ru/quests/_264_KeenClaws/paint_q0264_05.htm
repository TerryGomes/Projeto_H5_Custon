Thank you. I see you have brought me fifty wolf claws. Now I can start on the special arrows that *Kiel* has ordered. I hope I can finish them in time, before he leaves for *Pabel*.

According to our contract, I will give you this. It may not be flashy, but it is light and very strong, and will surely be useful one day. Now, shall we go our separate ways? May the shelter of the abyss envelope you until we meet again.
