!Trader Payne:

The arrows sold in this store are specially crafted by my hands. As you know, the shaft is made from ash and the tips are made from steel or adamantium.

But sometimes I get orders for custom-made arrows. For example, the *Assassin Kiel Nighthawk* has ordered a claw-shaped arrowhead made of wolf claws. He is away at the siege battle in *Giran* right now, but I am sure he will order arrowheads again when he returns. I'd like you to help me gather the wolf claws when that time comes.
