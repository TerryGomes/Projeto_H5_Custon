!Trader Payne:

The arrows sold in this store are specially crafted by my hands. As you know, the shaft is made from ash and the tips are made from steel or adamantium.

But sometimes I get orders for custom-made arrows. Just a few days ago, *Assassin Kiel Knighthawk* placed an order for claw-shaped arrows made from *wolf claws.* Hooked arrows made from claws are difficult to pull out once they are lodged in the body, and create great internal wounds.

*Kiel* said that he had to leave for a castle siege soon and to complete the arrows within a week. However, time is too short and I must ask your assistance. Could you help me gather the wolf claws?
