!Trader Payne:

According to the contract we have entered into, you must gather *fifty wolf claws* and bring them to me. You can acquire the claws by hunting the *ashen wolves* or *goblins* outside of the village. The lowest goblins have crude talismans made by stringing wolf claws.

Now hurry! There is not much time left.
