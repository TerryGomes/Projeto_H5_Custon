Thank you. Your task is fairly simple. Collect *fifty wolf claws* and bring them to me. You can acquire the claws by hunting the *ashen wolves* or *goblins* outside of the village. The lowest goblins have crude talismans made by stringing wolf claws.

As a reward for helping me, I will give you one of the defense items from my store. I swear on the eye of *Shilen* which observes everything, that I will faithfully fulfill the terms of our contract.

Wonderful! I thank you in advance. There is not much time, so please hurry.
