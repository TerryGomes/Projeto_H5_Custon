!Office Tepios:

After several attempts, each area was finally <font color="LEVEL">stabilized</font> once we occupied the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity</font>. But now the power of Ekimus is again growing, and the undead have again begun to awaken.

Our scouts think they will soon attack the <font color="LEVEL">Hall of Suffering</font>. If this area falls, the whole Seed will again fall under Ekimus' influence. That must not be allowed to happen.

We need volunteers to help <font color="LEVEL">defend the Hall of Suffering</font>. Will you join them?

[Quest _695_DefendtheHallofSuffering tepios_q695_2.htm|Say yes.]
