!Inventor Maru:

My invention? Ah, I'm flattered that you are interested! I am working on an *"energy converter"*.
 It transforms a common mineral into a crystal filled with powerful energy. If I am successful, I'm sure this will become as famous as the Soulshot!

I don't have enough time to review my blueprints and find all the materials I need, though... Will you help me find the materials?

I'll pay you for every mineral you bring me. Please bring as many as you can!
