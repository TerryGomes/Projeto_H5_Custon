!Inventor Maru:

Yes, that's it. The Energy Ore!

If this works, I will be able to transform this common substance into a perfect instant energy crystal. Thank you for your help.

If you have time, would you collect some more materials?
 The energy converter device's success rate is still low, so I need as much Energy Ore as I can get for more tests.
 What do you say? Will you help me again?
