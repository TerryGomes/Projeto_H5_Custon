!Inventor Maru:
Thank you so much! That will be very helpful! Let me tell you about the materials I need.
 They are called *"Energy Ore"*.

Fortunately, you can easily acquire them by hunting the monsters in the *Eastern Mining Zone* to the north of the Dwarven Village.
 Let's see, the monsters there are mostly *Red Eye Barbed Bats, Northern Trimden, Kerop Werewolves, Kerop Werewolf Chiefs, Northern Goblins, Northern Goblin Leaders, Spine Golems and Enchanted Spine Golems*.
 Those are the monsters you'll have to face. Understand?

Now, please gather as many Energy Ore as possible. Ah! I am far too busy! Too busy! I need to hurry up and review the blueprint. Good luck!
