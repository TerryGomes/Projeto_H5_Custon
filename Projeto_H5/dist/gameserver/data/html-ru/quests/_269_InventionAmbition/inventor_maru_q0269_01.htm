(From his bag, takes out a book entitled *"Dwarves: A History of Brilliant Inventions"* and begins reading.)

*"During the Age of Empire, "Soren," a great inventor of the Black Anvil Guild, invented the Soulshot in the hope that when the light of the spirits entered a weapon, the Dwarven warrior who wielded it would become even more formidable..."*
