!Elder Cronos:

Whether I know how to do it or not is not your concern...

You should talk to *Fairy Mymyu* in the Enchanted Valley. Actually, she was the one I got your hatchling from! I have kept in touch with her since our last encounter. We have become friendly. I will send her a letter asking her to take good care of you and your hatchling... Do you understand what I'm saying to you?
