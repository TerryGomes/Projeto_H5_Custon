!Fairy Mymyu:

The four fairy trees are connected. Their roots traverse unimaginable depths to touch the Mother Tree Glade in the Elven Forest. The Essence of Wind, star, twilight and the abyss respectively flow within the trunks of these trees... These elements are essential for a hatchling to mature properly... Legend says that these trees were planted long ago by King Raul after he met the Lady of the Lake. He did this at the behest of the Lady of the Lake to stop the poisonous smog that was coming over from Dragon Valley. Now, in the northern section of the valley, *those damn hunters have settled down....*

And there is one thing that you have to be absolutely careful about! While this sap is indispensible for a hatchling's growth, it is a deadly poison to your race. *If you handle a fairy tree, you will likely get sick and die.*
