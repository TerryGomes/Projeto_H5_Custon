!Sir Eric Rodemai:

Very good! Slaughter *Shilen's Priest Hisilrome* and bring me his Heart!

*As I told you before, you dont't have to kill her yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Shilen's Priest Hisilrome and then bring his Nucleus to me.
