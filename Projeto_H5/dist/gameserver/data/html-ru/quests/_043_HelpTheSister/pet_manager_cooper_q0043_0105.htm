!Pet Manager Cooper:

Oh, wonderful! You survivied!

Frankly, even though I often say that I want to move away, it's hard to leave the big city! I must have adena to live in the territory right now!

I was saving up a little every day, but when I returned home one day, I found that my sister had disappeared! She left a note saying that she was going out in the world to help me!

I couldn't do much as her older brother, but I've heard that her name is on a list of graduates from Talking Island.

I must see her, if only to give her a sword! I hate to ask you this so suddenly, but...

Can you help me?
