I could just send a sword to my sister, but I'm worried about her. I'm afraid she's in great danger on the road to Giran! Hunt *specters and sorrow maidens on the Execution Ground*. Please kill at least 30.

Last night I dreamed that specters and sorrow maidens were chasing my sister. The more you kill, the better her chances are!
