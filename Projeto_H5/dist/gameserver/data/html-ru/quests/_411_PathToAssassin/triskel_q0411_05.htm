Hmm ... So the likes of you wants to change profession to an Assassin? Good. As luck would have it, I was just now in need of a nimble fellow. You must know that the foundation of an Assassin is quick movements! Use this opportunity to prove your skills to me! Now take this and go to *Arkenia of the Dark Elf coming-of-age ceremony altar. *

You don't know how to go to the coming-of-age ceremony altar? Wretched fellow! Go out the east gate of the village and run to the north! Then you will reach the Neutral Zone. There is a bridge to the west that connects to the Dark Forest. After you cross the bridge, follow the road west until you reach the altar.
