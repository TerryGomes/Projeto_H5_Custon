!Guard Leikan:

Oh, great! Thank you for your trouble. Now I will tell you about the thieves.

The ringleader is an Orc named *Calpico*. The fellow is very elusive, so you never know when he will show up or where, but a few days ago a report said that he was seen near the *School of Dark Arts* in the Dark Forest. If you search in the vicinity of the School of Dark Arts, you will be able to find the scoundrel's hiding place.

I don't know why Calpico would steal holy articles from the Dark Elves ... I'm sure there is someone else behind it, don't you think?
