Thank you. I have asked about the whereabouts of the thieves and have some intelligence. The most reliable information is kept by a Human by the name of *Leikan*. *He works as a guard in the village of Gludin.*

It seems that the Human Traders of his village have been robbed many times by those thieves as well. I heard that Leikan is investigating the thieves. Take this letter and go to him. Please hurry.
