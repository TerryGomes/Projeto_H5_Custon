!Head Researcher Sobling:

Excellent! You came back! Was it difficult to collect ancient pieces?

Hum... what is it? You have some ancient scrolls here, but those are of no use to me until you translate its contents,
 i have no time to do it on my own and that's why i gave you the dictionary.
 Anyway i can check any other ancient item you may have...
