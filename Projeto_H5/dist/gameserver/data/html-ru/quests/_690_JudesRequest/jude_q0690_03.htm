!Jude:

Bear in mind that what I'm looking for are not run-of-the-mill weapons carried by common
monsters within the Steel Citadel. No, I need weapons from the Lesser Evils and Greater Evils that are found
in *Monster Foundry*. Other Evil Weapons are useless! Understand?

Bring me *200 Evil Weapons* and I'll give you the *S80 Grade weapon recipe* in exchange. Or I can give you
*3 S80 Grade weapon pieces* for every *5 Evil Weapons* you bring me.
