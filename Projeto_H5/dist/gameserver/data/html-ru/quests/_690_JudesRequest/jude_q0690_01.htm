!Jude:

It is rumored that somewhere in the Steel Citadel is a place where very powerful monsters are created.
Amazing, is't it? To think that someone is actually creating monsters...

I must admit that while i'm not particularly interested in what goes on in the Steel Citadel, some of the Evil Weaponry
I've seen from there was of really excellent quality. In fact, it would be difficult to find its equal anywhere in Aden.
If I could study these weapons and learn how to refine them, I could make a fortune!

Will you get me some of the weapons? I'll pay you handsomely...
