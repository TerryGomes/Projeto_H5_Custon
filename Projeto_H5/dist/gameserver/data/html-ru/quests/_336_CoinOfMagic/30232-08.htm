!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Why do you look so disappointed? You must not know how precious the membership card is! Do you think anybody can join our coin collection guild?

Once you develop a taste for coin collecting, you will realize how valuable a membership card is. After collecting various coins, in order to trade your coins with other members, you are required to have a membership card! But, according to our rules, you cannot trade with a member whose grade is higher than yours. But as long as you continue to be active, I promise to raise your grade. So don't worry! Ah! One more thing. If you bring back your collected coins for each grade, you can exchange them with some great prize items I, Sorint prepared. This is a great opportunity that you shouldn't take for granted!
