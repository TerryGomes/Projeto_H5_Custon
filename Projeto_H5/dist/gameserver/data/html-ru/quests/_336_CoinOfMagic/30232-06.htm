!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

So, where is my coin? What? You haven't gotten it yet? If you come back empty-handed, did you think that I would praise you?! What I want is the "kaldis gold dragon" coin that Bernard has!

It's not Blood DreVanul!

It's not Silver Unicorn!

It is the *Gold! Dragon! Of Kaldis!*

Understand?!!!
