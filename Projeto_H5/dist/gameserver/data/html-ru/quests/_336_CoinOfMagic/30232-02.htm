!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Vigorous yet cautious manner of walking... like that of a tiger! Sharp eyed like a hawk! You, must be an adventurer of considerable skills! Yes, someone like you must be able to help me. Please take pity on a poor man like me and help me out. I am having a lot of heartache because of this stubborn fellow. If you can obtain a small object and bring it to me, I will pay you a generous sum of reward money.
