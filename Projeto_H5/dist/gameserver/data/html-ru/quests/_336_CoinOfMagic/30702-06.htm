!Bernard, Hunter Union President:

To be honest with you... after you came to visit me, I was intrigued by what you said and did some research. By getting help from my union members, I found out the areas where the coins are discovered often.

Let me see... What I have found out so far is that... *Lakin* and *vanor silenos* in the southern part of Aden, and * timak orcs* of northern Oren are in possession of these coins.

Also, *Bandits' Stronghold in Oren, the Cemetery of Kings in Aden and Dragon Valley * are the places where the coins are often discovered.
