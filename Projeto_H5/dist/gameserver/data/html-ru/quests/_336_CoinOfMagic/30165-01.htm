!Magic Trader Ralford:

Isn't the power of magic great? It turned this item into such a beautiful object. Although I'm just a simple trader, I can't help but bow my head to such a masterpiece...

By the way what would you like to trade for it? All I have are these coins... and, if you would like to trade with me, you will need *Gold Drake, Gold Knight, Silver Golem, Blood Drevanuls, Blood Werewolf and Silver Fairies*. Take a look at my items and make a choice.
