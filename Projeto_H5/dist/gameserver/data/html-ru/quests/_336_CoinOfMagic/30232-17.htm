!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Ah...! Ah...!!! You really managed to collect all of the precious coins. I fill like crying... sniffle sniffle...!

Ah, sorry. I'm making a fool of myself... Only a very few members successfully achieve grade 1 member status. Therefore, this is a great occasion for our coin collectors guild to celebrate. Congratulations!
