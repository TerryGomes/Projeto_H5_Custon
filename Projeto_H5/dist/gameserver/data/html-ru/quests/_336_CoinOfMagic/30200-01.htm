!Guard Stan:

I had my own reason to apply for the guard position. While I stand here on my guard duty, I have the chance to meet with people from all over the world, and this gives me the opportunity to collect rare coins. Heh heh heh.

By the way, what would you like to trade with? These are all the coins I have... Also if you would like to trade with me, you will need *Blood Werewolf, Blood Drevanul, Gold knight, Gold Drake, Silver Golem or Silver Fairy*. Make your choice from what I have.
