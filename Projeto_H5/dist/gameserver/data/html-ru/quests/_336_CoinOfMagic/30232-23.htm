!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Ah, why don't I tell you who our current members are?

First, there is *Sorceress Page* of the mystics guild in the Hunters' Village, *Researcher Lorain* who is located at the entrance of Cruma Tower, *Warehouse Keeper Hagger* of Oren Castle Town, *Guard Stan* of Oren Castle Town, *Blacksmith Duning* of the Hunters' Village, *Trader Ralford* at the basement of the Ivory Tower, *Head Blacksmith Ferris* of Aden Castle Town, *Warehouse Keeper Collob* who is located in front of the accessory store in Giran Castle Town and *Grocer Pano* in the square of Floran Village...

Wow, now I realize that our members are spread out all over the place. But we still have a long way to go. My dream is that the coins we are collecting will become a secondary currency! Then everybody on the continent will become members of our club! Ha ha ha!! Won't that be great?
