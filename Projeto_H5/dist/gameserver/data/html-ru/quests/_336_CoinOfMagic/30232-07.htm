!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Ah! You brought it back for me! It's the "kaldis gold dragon" coin! Oooh hee hee heee.... I'm happy!!! Sooo happy!!! My precious treasure! Please enter my collection box!

Ahem...! Hey! Hmm... you are a really capable fellow. I was going to pay you some money to finish our transaction. But I changed my mind. Some one with your skill is sufficiently qualified to become our member! Here! This is the cc membership 3 everybody is wanting to have. What do you think? Aren't you happy?

Well, ahem... I'm going to take another look at my new treasure...
