Ah, you haven't been a member for long, I see. I'm sorry that you went to the trouble of coming this far...? Anyway, coin collection is really great. It's not difficult... And you can trade in a place like this... And if you do it for a long time you can get unexpected income, no?

After all, that's what these coins are for. Take a look. If you want to trade, bring me a lot of *Blood Medusas, Golden Wyverns and Silver Unicorns*.
