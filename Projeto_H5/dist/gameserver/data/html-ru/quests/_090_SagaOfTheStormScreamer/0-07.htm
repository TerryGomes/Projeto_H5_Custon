!Grand Magister Fairen:

I realized, after suffering your awesome attack, that you'd actually become more powerful than any disciple I'd ever taught! I knew at that moment I didn't have to worry about you anymore, so I backed off!%%
I realize I can't keep you in the nest forever. At some point I must let you go.%%
Please forgive me! I was wrong. Your diligence is inspiring. Congratulations! You're now a Storm Screamer!
