!Grand Magister Fairen:

So you want to become a Storm Screamer, eh? Well, I suppose you're ready. I'd hoped that you would at least preserve your appearance!%%
When you become a Storm Screamer, you'll actually break free of this mortal coil and enter the realm of the gods! You must absorb their very power into your body! Long ago, the foolish* gods sealed the power* in an attempt to keep Humans from reaching their full potential.
