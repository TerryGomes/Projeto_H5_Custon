!Grand Magister Fairen:

Well, I suppose you have your mind made up, eh? Well, I won't try to stop you.%%
But I'll give you one last piece of advice: the Tablet of Vision cannot be read with your eyes alone. You must use a* Stone of Commune* to truly comprehend its message. This is known as* communing with the tablet*. At one time, the Stone of Commune was very rare, but lately, it's been turning up everywhere! I think that dark forces are behind this!%%
Now, go and speak with* Magister Kamilen* in Goddard Castle Town. He'll tell you what to do next.%%
Good luck! Pick up a copy of the guild bulletin on your way out!
