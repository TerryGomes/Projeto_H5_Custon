!Magister Kamilen:

Then visit the* Ketra Orcs* to* get the missing fragment, the Divine Stone of Wisdom*. If you earn the trust of Asefa, guide of dead souls, through Ketra's Messenger Wahkan and prove to her your wisdom, you'll find it.%%
If you change your mind halfway, you can get it from the best Shaman of Varka Silenos, Soul Guide Udan Mardui through Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk., just bring it to me.
