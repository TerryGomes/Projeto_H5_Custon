!Summoner Belinda:

First, you must speak with* Messenger Naran Ashanuk* of the Varka Silenos tribe. They've been hiring mercenaries, and this is a great opportunity to earn their trust!%%
*Soul Guide Udan Mardui*, the Chief Shaman of the Varka Silenos, has something they call the* Divine Stone of Wisdom*. You must get it from them!%%
If things don't go well with the Varka, you should try the Ketra Orc tribe. They also have one of the stones. Good luck!
