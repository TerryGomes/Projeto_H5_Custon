!Tablet of Vision:

When you hold the Stone of Commune in your hands and concentrate, the Tablet of Vision is slowly surrounded by bright light. Hundreds of voices begin pounding in your head... they seem to be reading some form of scripture, a scripture that reveals a great and horrible truth. Ah, the fundamental truth of all things is revealed! But wait, I can't understand any of it! Before your eyes, a beautiful blonde lady and a knight wearing black armor show up, but quickly vanish.%%
You begin to understand where the next Stone of Commune is... a temple in Goddard Castle Town... Summoner Belinda... she has the Stone of Commune in her hands. Unlike before, the light from the Stone of Commune shimmers very faintly.%%
The images fade and the light turns to darkness..
