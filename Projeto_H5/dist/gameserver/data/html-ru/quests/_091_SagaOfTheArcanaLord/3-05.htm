!Summoner Belinda:

Those idiotic barbarians worship the stone fragment, and call it their Divine Stone of Wisdom! It's actually a part of the Stone of Commune we need! If we can get it, I 'll join it with this other fragment I have to form the Stone of Commune!

[Quest _091_SagaOfTheArcanaLord 3-8|"Here it is. Join the fragments together."]
