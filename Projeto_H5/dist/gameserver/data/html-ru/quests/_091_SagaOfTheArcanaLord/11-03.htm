!Summoner Belinda:

Wherever you find him, you must kill the* Archon of Halisha* if you are to get the fifth Stone of Commune.%%
At the Imperial Tomb, you'll find him in the Four Sepulchers. At the Shrine of the Loyal, he'll appear after you destroy many of his minions.%%
Please, get going! Good luck!
