Thank you so much... There is still chivalry left in this world! You've made me realize that I can still have adventures! I'll show those whippersnappers! It's so nice to meet someone like you who understands me..
If you ever visit *the Town of Oren*... speak with *Grocer Sara*, my daughter-in-law. She's a good one who's always worrying about me... She'll reward you for your good heart.
I'm going back home then...

Good luck.
