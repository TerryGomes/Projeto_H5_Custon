!Priest Dustin:

Ah, you're from the boutique shop! Excellent timing, I just finished Mr. Galladucci's order!

That curse was very powerful, and I had to ask several priests to help me remove it! I can't believe he was able to hold onto that thing the way it was! Well, now it's been completely purified and made safe.

Here it is! Please deliever this necklace to Mr. Galladucci at the boutique shop. May the tranquility of Einhasad be with you always!
