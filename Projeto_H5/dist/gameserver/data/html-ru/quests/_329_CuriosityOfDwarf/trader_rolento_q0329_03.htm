Good! We understand each other well. Actually, I recently had a chance to see a destroyed granite golem, and within the remains I saw a piece of stone of a different hue. I asked Sal, who has profound knowledge of magic, and he said the stone was a *heartstone*. I found out that all the golems made by the magicians had a heartstone in the center of their bodies.

What was it that he said? Something about putting a symbolic heart that resembles the living body into a still stone figure, and then gathering the magic forces before beginning the spells ... . Of course I didn't understand a word of what he was talking about, but anyway, it seems almost certain that the heartstone is the power source of the golem.

So, I would like you to go into the Wastelands and get me the *heartstone of a golem*. There are many *granite golems* in the Wastelands. There are also granite golems that are nicknamed *punchers,* because they brandish their fists about fiercely.

Most heartstones shatter or crack when the golem is killed, but very rarely you can obtain whole, perfect heartstones. I would like you to bring me all the heartstones you can find -- whether they be broken or whole. I will compensate you for as many as you bring back. Of course, I will be more generous for *perfect heartstones*.
