!Master Rindy:

Cadet! I am Rindy, a commander in the Steelrazor, the elite force of the Kamael. So you are the one who captured Tak, eh?

You did well, and we learned much. But what is your business with me now?

Hmm...you wish to become an Arbalester, eh?

The entrance exam is very difficult, you know...

Do you really want to be a Arbalester?
