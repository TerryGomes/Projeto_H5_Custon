!Master Rindy:

If you have information or secrets they are interested in, they may try to find you first...

Wait a minute -- let me check some information reported be the Stellrazor...

Hmm... According to this, *Dark Elven Magister Clayton in the Town of Dion* knows the important secret concerning our race...

The secret group may be interested in this information.

If you wish to join, perhaps a meeting with Clayton will help your chances...
