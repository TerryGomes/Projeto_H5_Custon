!Magister Kaiena: 

Ha!

Gauen had the gall to say such things!?

It is he who wished to keep the Giants' research documents.

His greed and duplicity are almost unbelievable...

He pretends to be an honorable man, but the real Gauen is a mystery.

I swear that what we did, we did to prevent the documents from falling into the nands of Beleth.

That was the perfect opportunity for Gauen to steal them himself and concort this lame excuse.

If he really had nothing to hide, why would he involve Manashen?
