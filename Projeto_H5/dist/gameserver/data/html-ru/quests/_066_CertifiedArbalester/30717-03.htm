!Magister Gauen:

The only reason why Kaiena concoted this plan was to learn the secrets of the Giants' research documents.

He only mentioned the followers of Beleth as an excuse to justify his actions.

The fact that he ordered Galios to involve the monster and carry out this plan tells me that something is not right.
