!Blacksmith Poitan:

Sorry!

The Giants, I mean -- sometimes I lapse into my native tongue, which is somewhat more...poetic. The Giants were a great race who lived long, long ago.

Through their science, they become almost the equal of the gods themselves.

Our Dwarven skills, as well as many of the magic items of the other races, were strongly influenced by their legacy...
