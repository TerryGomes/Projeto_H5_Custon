!Grand Master Meldina:

Very well...

Hand me the encrypted manuscript you have brought.

I know the contents of the manuscript, but it is something not suited for you... yet.

Do not be disappointed, however. You will have an opportunity to learn it later for yourself.

In the meantime, take this badge and find *Selsia in Hunters Village*.

There you will receive further instructions.

I have every confidence in you, my young friend.

Good luck!
