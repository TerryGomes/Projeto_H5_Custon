!Master Rindy:

Very well, I will tell you.

As you know, Kamael society is organized along military lines.

Certain necessary tasks must be conducted in secret for the good of our society.

We are the group entrusted to carry out those sensitive missions.

All our members are able to use Arbalester skills.

If you can find our secret group and pass the entrance test, you too can aspire to be an Arbalester...

*Take this Dimension Diamond. You can trade it to the village gatekeeper for the Scroll of Escape for the town where you want to go...*
