!Grand Master Meldina:

I am member of the secret society you have been investigating...

We are called Inquisitors among those who know of our existence.

It is our responsibility to protect the secrets of the Kamael, as well as to unearth conspiracies that might threaten our people. Our work is highly secretive.

We have watched you face dangers and solve problems to obtain this manuscript, and we think you have the skills to take the class transfer test.

If you pass if, you will obtain a power that can take you beyond your current combat skill, just like the rest of our order.

What do you say? Are you interested?
