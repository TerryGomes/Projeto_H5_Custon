!Master Rindy:

Hey, there! I am Rindy, a chief officer of the Kamael Special Forces, Steelrazor. You're the one who captured Tak, aren't you?

Thanks to you, I have been able to gather a lot of useful information. Good work!

Ah, I see that you're interested in becoming an Arbalester.

I hate to tell you this, but I don't think that you are quite experienced enough now to pursue that path.

Why don't you train some more and come back later...
