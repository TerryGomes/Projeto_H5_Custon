!Magister Gauen:

Both Kaiena's men and our forces were exhausted from fighting each other.

At that moment, Beleth's well-known female minion appeared and took the documents.

Undoubtedly Beleth was as eager to possess those documents as Kaiena was.

He must have learned about them throught our quarrel with Kaiena.

That is the truth, whatever others tell you.

Do not be deceived!

(Speak with *Kaiena* as well.)
