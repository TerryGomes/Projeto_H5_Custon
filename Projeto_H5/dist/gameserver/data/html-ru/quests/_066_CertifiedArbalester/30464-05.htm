!Magister Clayton:

Actuall, I had asked a Dwarven Artisan to craft a certain tool I require for my magic experiment.

He sent back a list of ingridients that he needs to craft it.

Although I have managed to obtain most of the materials on his list.

I have had no luck procuring any Grudge Crystals.

Please go to *Floran Village*, hunt the *Watchman of the Plains*, the *Roughly-Hewn Rock Golem*, the *Delu Lizardman Supplier*, the *Delu Lizardman Special Agent*, the *Cursed Seer*, the *Delu Lizardman Commander* and the *Delu Lizardman Shaman*, and bring back *30 Enmity Crystals*.
