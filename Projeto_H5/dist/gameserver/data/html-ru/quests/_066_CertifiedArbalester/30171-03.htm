!Magister Gaius: 

Well, one of the followers of that villain Beleth managed to obtain certain secrets about the Kamael.

They were in a document that contained excerpts of medical research conducted by the Giants.

Our lord discovered that this information was passed to the other followers of Beleth in Oren, then spread magically to other unknown places.

The original spy is high-ranking official in Giran, however, and we simply did have sufficient evidence to expose him as Beleth's follower...

This situation was extremely urgent, and there simply was no other way for us to handle matters.

I hope you understand...
