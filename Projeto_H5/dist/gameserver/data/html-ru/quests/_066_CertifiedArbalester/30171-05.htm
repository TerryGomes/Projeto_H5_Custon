!Magister Gaius: 

Well, yes and no.

One of our operatives did recover the document near Death Pass, but...

while en route to us, he was attacked by the *Manashen Gargoyles near the Ivory Tower*. We have not been able to locate either him or the document he was carrying.

The timing of the attack is no coincidence; something must have gone very wrong...
