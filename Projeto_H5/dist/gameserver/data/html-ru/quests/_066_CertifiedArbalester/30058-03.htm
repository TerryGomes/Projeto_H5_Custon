!Warehouse Keeper Holvas:

Is that so? Well, if Poitan saw fit to tell you, then I guess I can tell you as well.

There are many people who are curious about you, you know...

That's why I think I can sell this manuscript for a handsome price!

I was able to procure the manuscript secretly, and I intended to have if brought here.

But during the journey, raiders attacked my messenger at the *Execution Grounds*. He cannot be found -- and neither can the manuscript.

Would you be willing to find the pieces of the manuscript?

If you gather all the pieces and bring them to me, I will bind a book for you free of charge.
