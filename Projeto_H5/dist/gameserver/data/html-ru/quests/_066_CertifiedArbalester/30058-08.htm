!Warehouse Keeper Holvas:

When I hold these pages up to the light, I can see hidden words here.

Hmmm...

These words are similar to the Kamael tongue, but they seem somehow older...

Besides being written in a dead language, it also appears to be written in a code that I can't decipher...

If you have studied under *Kamael Grand Master Meldina in Giran Castle*, you may be able to read it...

Mmm... I will give you a copy of the code, just in case...

In any event, thank you for your help.
