!Master Selsia:

Welcome to Hunters Village. I received the message from Grand Master Meldina...

As you know, we manage and protect information.

This place may seem simple and unassuming, but spies from many differenet races exchange information, concort plots and hatch conspiracies here...

I think the village became such a nest of espionage because of its independence and isolated location, as well as certain events surrounding its establishment during the war.

So be careful! Even the most ordinary-looking trader may be very different than he appears...

We do cooperate with some of the other races' spies, but the alliances are never permanent.
