!Magister Clayton:

Ah, finally finished!

My magical experiment is actually only a part of a much larger scheme designed to release the seal of our greatest elder.

This elder has existed since ancient times, so he may also have been alive when your race was created...

As fat as I know, your race was relatively free from the influence of the gods on this continent -- what you call the Outer World.

It is said that this was due to some unique feature of your race and uts origin... I do not know any details beyond that.

Perhaps the Dwarves possess more information -- they have held on to many of the ancient secrets in their quest to rediscover the Giants' science.

Perhaps *Blacksmith Poitan in the Town of Dion*, to whom this ingridient must be delivered, can tell you more.

He is, after all, widely recognized as a scholar even among the Dwarves.

Well? Would you like to meet him? If so, will you deliver this ingredient to him as well?
