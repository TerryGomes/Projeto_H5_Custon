!Blacksmith Poitan:

I heard that a Dwarven explorer discovered some records left by the Giants about your race at the Giants' Ruins.

Unfortunately, both he and the records seem to have disappeared. Nobody knows if he is alive or dead...

I heard this from my close friend *Holvas*, so if you're interested in that book, I think you should ask him about it.

I seem to remember him telling me that he might be able to get a copy... Whu don't you go see him?
