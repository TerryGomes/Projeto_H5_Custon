!Hierarch Asterios:

Have you felt anything strange lately while walking around the village? I recently saw yellow, withered leaves on the surface of the pond in the middle of the village, under the *Mother Tree*. I don't know why a tree that has grown for thousands of years should suddenly drop discolored, withered leaves. I am very worried. I will delve deeper into this, but if further investigation is necessary, I may have to ask you to aid me in investigating this matter.
