!Grand Magister Valdis:

Too bad! I need you to slaughter *Hestia, Guardian Deity of the Hot Springs* and bring me her Stone!

*As I told you before, you don't have to kill him yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Hestia, Guardian Deity of the Hot Springs and then bring her Stone to me.
