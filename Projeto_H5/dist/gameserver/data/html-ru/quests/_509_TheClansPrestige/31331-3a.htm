!Grand Magister Valdis:

Too bad! I need you to slaughter *Plague Golem* and bring me his Nucleus!

*As I told you before, you don't have to kill him yourself!* There's no rule that says the Clan Leader has to get his hands bloody! Just stand in a safe place an watch your Clan kill Plague Golem and then bring his Nucleus to me.
