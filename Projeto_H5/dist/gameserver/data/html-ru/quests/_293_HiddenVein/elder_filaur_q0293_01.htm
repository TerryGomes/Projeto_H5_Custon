!Elder Filaur:

Have you heard of a metal called *crysolite*? This material is used by the maestros to craft high quality armor and weapons. Until now, the entire supply has been imported from Gracia, but we have just discovered that there are veins of this rare metal not very far from here.

We're planning to work on developing these new veins soon, and need the help of energetic young Dwarves. I'll ask you for help soon, so be prepared.
