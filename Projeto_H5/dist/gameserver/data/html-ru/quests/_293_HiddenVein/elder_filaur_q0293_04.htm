!Elder Filaur:

I am sorry, but if you come back with empty hands I can't reward you, no matter how hard you tried. As I mentioned before, I will reward you based on the amount of *crysolite ore* that you collect after defeating *the Utuku Orcs*.

And don't forget ...*If you collect four pieces of a torn map, you should visit Chichirin in the Maphr Temple*. If you ask her for help, she will combine those torn pieces and make a complete map. I will give you a generous reward once you bring me the completed maps.
