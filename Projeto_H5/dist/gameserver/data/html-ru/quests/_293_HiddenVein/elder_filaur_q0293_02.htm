!Elder Filaur:

While I was making an inspection of the Mithril Mine, I was attacked by *Utuku Orcs*. Fortunately, my guards defeated the Orcs, but I found out something very interesting...

Rough ore was found in the pockets of the defeated Orcs, and I assume it is used as currency between Orcs. The guards are all members of the Iron Gate and didn't recognize the ore, but I noticed at once that the ore is *rough crysolite*.

As you know, crysolite is used by the maestros to make high quality armor and weapons. Until now, the entire supply has been imported from Gracia, but this incident has provided a new method of acquiring that rare metal. But to take advantage of this opportunity, I need the help of young, energetic Dwarves like you.
