!Elder Filaur:

If you leave the village and go to the minefield, you will see many *Utuku Orcs*. Bring me *the crysolite ore* that you collect after defeating them. I will reward you based on the amount of the ore you bring back.

But more importantly, you should find out where the ore comes from. I ordered some investigators of the guild to find out, but I haven't gotten any useful information from them. I only know that there are many hidden crysolite veins somewhere in the Spine Mine Field, and only a few Utuku Orcs know the locations.

Sending investigators was a mistake, because the Orcs now know that the veins are important. I hear they tore the *maps that indicate the location of the veins* into many pieces and scattered them throughout the territory. If you find the pieces of the maps, you must go to *Maphr Priestess Chichirin* in the temple. She will help you to combine the maps. I will give you a generous reward once you bring me the completed maps.
