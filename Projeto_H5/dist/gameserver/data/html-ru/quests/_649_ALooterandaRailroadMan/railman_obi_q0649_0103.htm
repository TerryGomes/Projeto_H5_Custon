!Railroad Worker Obi:

The Bandits around these parts are known as *Rayito's Bandits*.

They're not very strong but they're tenacious like bugs at a picnic.

They survive by hunting the wild beasts around here. They use the beasts' teeth to decorate themselves!

Nasty!

Bring me *proof that you killed 200 Bandits* and I will give you reward.
