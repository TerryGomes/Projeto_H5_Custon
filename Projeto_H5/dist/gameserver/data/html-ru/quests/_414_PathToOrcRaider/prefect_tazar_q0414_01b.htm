!Prefect Tazeer:

Very well! Then pay close attention!

The *Timora Orcs* betrayed us by joining dreaded Ragna Orcs, who have long been the scourge of this area. They can usually be found near *the lake between the Crypts of Disgrace and the Den of Evil*. They hide in Den of Evil whenever they hear that we're sending a powerful Orc after them.

Letting their betrayal go unchallenged would harm the reputation of the entire Orc Kingdom! If we secretly send an unknown Orc like you after them, they might be taken off-guard...

Please, destroy the Timora Orcs!
