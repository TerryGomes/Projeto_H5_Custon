!Prefect Karukia:

You have not yet proven your loyalty! There are many traitors hiding far away in Gludin to avoid our eyes! They think they are safe, but we have not forgotten them. Go on now and put an end to the betrayers and prove your loyalty!

When you complete this task, take the heads of the two traitors to *Prefect Kasman in the village of Gludin*. If you have truly earned the qualifications to become an Orc Raider, you will receive a token to change profession from him.
