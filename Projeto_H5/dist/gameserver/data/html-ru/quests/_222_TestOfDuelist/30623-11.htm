!Duelist Kaien:

I personally selected your opponents for the trial in *Oren*. First you shall fight the *leto lizardman Overlord* that lives in the southern regions of Oren, and your second opponent will be the *enchanted monster eye* that wanders the area surrounding the Ivory Tower of Oren. Stay alert, as both are formidable enemies!

Bring back 10 leto lizardman amulets, and 10 pieces of strengthened monster eye meat.
