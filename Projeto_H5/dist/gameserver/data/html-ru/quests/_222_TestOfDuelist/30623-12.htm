!Duelist Kaien:

Last of all you must visit the territory of *Aden*... This territory is under martial law and many areas are off limits...

In the southern region of Aden, you will find the *Tamlin Orcs*. Defeat them and the *Tamlin Orc Archers*. Bring back 10 Tamlin Orc rings and 10 Tamlin Orc arrows.

Do you remember your mission in each territory? Always remember this motto: "I shall not surrender, I shall be victorious..."  One day the Mark will be yours.
