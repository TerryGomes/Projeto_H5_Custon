!Duelist Kaien:

You have defeated all of the opponents of the final trial...! Excellent!  Now not only have you conquered all of the territories of Aden, but also Aden itself! Magnificent! I, duelist Kaien, hereby acknowledge your skills and talents and bestow upon you the *Mark of the Duelist*. Congratulations!

If you practice swordsmanship regularly, one day you may have the chance to draw against me... I shall wait for that day!
