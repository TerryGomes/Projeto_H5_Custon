!Duelist Kaien:

Greetings, young warrior. My name is Kaien and I am a 'duelist' belonging from the arena at Shutguart. My quest is to travel the continent to discover talented swordsmen and train them as duelists.

Though the kingdoms of Elmore and Aden are hostile to one another, that does not influence the affairs of a guild... My wish is to train as many duelists as possible and pass on the splendid tradition of swordsmanship of the Warrior Guild on this continent...
