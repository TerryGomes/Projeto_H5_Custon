!Duelist Kaien:

Originally the term Duelist meant 'challenger.' It was a term used to refer to those who displayed their dazzling talents in the arena at Shutguart, who bathed themselves in the blood of their rivals and regarded this as their honor. Now it is a title given to those whose skills with their weapon have reached their zenith. It is an title desired by all that wield a weapon, but only a select few may attain it, and only after many years of training...

If you desire to obtain the *Mark of the Duelist*, you must pass the trial that I, Duelist Kaien, give you.
