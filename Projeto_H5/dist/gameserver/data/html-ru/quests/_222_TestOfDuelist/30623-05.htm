!Duelist Kaien:

Greetings, young traveler. I am Duelist Kaien.

The original meaning of the word 'duelist' was 'Challenger.' It was used to describe those who exhibited their dazzling talents in the arena at Shutguart. They bathed in the blood of their rivals and regarded that as an honor.

Now this title is given to those whose weapons skills have reached their zenith. It is an honor desired by all that wield a weapon, but only a select few may attain this title, and only after many years of training...

If you wish to obtain the *Mark of the Duelist* you must pass the trial that I, Duelist Kaien, give you.

Only recently have we started to alllow Orc Warriors like yourself to attempt this trial. I must confess that in the past, we did not acknowledge any weapon other than the sword, and did not hold the battle skills of the Orcs in very high regard. My mind was changed when I saw an Orc shatter a granite golem into pieces in a matter of seconds!
