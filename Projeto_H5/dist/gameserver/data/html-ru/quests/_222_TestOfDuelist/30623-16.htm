!Duelist Kaien:

First you must slay the *excuro* and the *krator* from the *Cruma Tower*. As a proof of your victory, bring back 3 Excuro Skins and 3 Krator Fragments. I trust that I don't need  to explain about the dangers of the Cruma Tower?

After this you must go to the *Corridor of Death* in Giran and fight the *Grandis*. Perhaps you have already heard of the savagery of the Grandis? 

Next find the *Timak Orc Overlord* from the *southern region of Oren* and challenge him. The Timak Orcs are a strong race, strong enough to hold their own against the guards of the Oren Lord. Furthermore, your opponent is the Overlord, so it will be best to view his skills as equal to that of the strongest warrior.

Finally, you must slay the *lakin* that wanders through all of *Aden*. It is a giant, violent animal, so make sure you are prepared. It would be good to have a trusted friend watching your back.

These orders contain a list of the opponents you must defeat, so consult them if needed.
