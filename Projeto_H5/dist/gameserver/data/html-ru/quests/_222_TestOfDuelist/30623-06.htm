!Duelist Kaien:

I have already explained to you the meaning of the word 'duelist.' The Duelist's Trial consists primarily of defeating in battle the strongest opponents from across the continent. You must burn with desire rather than tremble and crouch
in fear when meeting a strong opponent... Strength and bravery are essential.

According to age-old duelist traditions, you must *'conquer all the territories of the kingdom'*. That is,
you must seek out the strongest opponents of each territory of the Aden Kingdom and engage in combat with them. Whoever is victorious in battle
against them will be awarded the Mark of the Duelist.

Are you ready to meet this challenge? I cannot stress enough that this is a very arduous task that will often test the limits of your patience.
