Abyssal Saintess Elcadia:

Really? In a place called Pavel Ruins, northeast from here, are Golems. I've placed tokens on them using a bit of magic. Defeat them and collect the tokens. Your test is to earn 10 tokens.

Don't look so glum. Maybe it's harder than you think, but either way I have to know who I'm dealing with.
