Priest Franz:

We don't have accurate information regarding the figure dispatched from the Dusk. But, the only thing is, that person is looking for an adventurer who has skills to accompany him. I thought that you would be qualified to work with him because you have skill, no? It was said that he's taken on the job very secretively, so approach him cautiously.
