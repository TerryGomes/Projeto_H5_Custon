!Master Gwain

Excellent! I like your boldness.

The test itself is very simple. You must defeat a certain malignant spirit to prove your bravery and strength and bring back the creature's heart as proof. But no matter how talented you may be, a lack of experience will make you easy prey for this spirit.

Therefore, before you begin the test, I advise you complete some additionl training. Frankly, I am sick of seeing the young of our race die meaningless deaths after taking on this challenge equipped with nothing but courage.

So go to *Gludin Village*, train under *Master Shubain* and bring back his *letter of recommendation*. Then we will discuss the details of the test.
