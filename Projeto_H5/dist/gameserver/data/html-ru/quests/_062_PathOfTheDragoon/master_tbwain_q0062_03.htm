!Master Gwain:

Ah, you have undoubtedly come here in order to become a Trooper. It is true that as a Trooper, you will be able to learn more and higher-level skills. But our guild only recognizes those whom we judge to be qualified and capable for this honor.

Put simply, to become a Trooper you must first take a test to prove yourself. I don't think you are yet ready to take the test -- come back when you are more experienced.

(Only male Kamael Soldiers who are level 18 and above may undertake this quest.)
