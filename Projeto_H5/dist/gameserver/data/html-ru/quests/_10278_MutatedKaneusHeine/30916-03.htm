Excellent! Visit the Kamaloka we can enter from Heine, kill the Kaneus there and extract their cellular tissues.<br>
You will face the <font color="LEVEL">Blade Otis</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Weird Bunei</font> Kaneus.<br>
When you have extracted all the cellular tissues of the Kaneus, take them to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Minevia</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. I know he and the other Sages will appreciate your efforts.<br>
Good hunting!
