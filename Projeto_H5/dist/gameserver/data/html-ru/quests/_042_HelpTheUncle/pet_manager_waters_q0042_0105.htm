!Pet Manager Waters:

Oh, you got it. Thank you.

My uncle suddenly is saying he wants to build a pastureland in the north. He wishes to become an adventurer to make money for the pastureland.

He says he is not a beginner anymore. But he still worries me... so I hope this might help him a little bit.

And.. It is really hard to ask *since you gave me a Trident*, but I have one request.
