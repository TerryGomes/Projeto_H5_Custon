!Chamberlain Neurath:

I have been contacted by your agent, my lord. Iason Heine has pledged his support if you can destroy the alligators who infest Alligator Island. I suggest you lead your clan members there and slay as many of the beasts as possible. If you kill 100 of them, their population level will not recover. Your agent, meanwhile, can find the freight stolen from the Heine family. Your leadership will be more necessary on Alligator Island...
