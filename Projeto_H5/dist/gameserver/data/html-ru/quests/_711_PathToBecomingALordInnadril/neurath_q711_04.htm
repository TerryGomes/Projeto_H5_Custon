!Chamberlain Neurath:

Have you heard of Innadril's distinguished Heine family? They have dominated the territory's trade for a long time; their wealth is astounding!

But I have recently heard that Iason Heine, the head of the family, has suffered some sort of commercial loss recently. Perhaps if you were to help him resolve the problem, he would throw his support behind you -- then there would be no problems in you being inaugurated as lord of Innadril.
