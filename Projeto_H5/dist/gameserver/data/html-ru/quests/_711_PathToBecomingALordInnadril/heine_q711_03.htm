!Iason Heine:

That's what I want to hear! Fine, let's see you prove it.

Innadril and Giran have just resolved a long-standing dispute about seaborne commerce rights, and full-scale trading between our two lands has finally begun. Unfortunately, it is already endangered by the lack of adequate protection. Even my family's losses have been significant!

To restore security, you must eliminate the monsters who roam freely around here. The alligators near Alligator Island are a particular thorn in my side. I'll also need help recovering my lost freight... I think 10 of your followers will do. If you do these things for me, I'll support your lord.

(Ten clan members must undertake the Black Swan quest. )
