Some freight belonging to Iason Heine's family was stolen by the Tasaba Lizardmen. The Heine family is recruiting adventurers to recover the freight, and I think you might gain real advantage by offering your assistance. Obviously you should not personally volunteer, but I think it would be wise to send someone you can trust, someone well-equipped to succeed in a mission of this kind.
