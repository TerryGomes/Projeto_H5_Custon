Holy Abyss Elcardia:

My request is simple. You should be with me for as long as I do not find the desired information. I was looking for an assistant who could be trusted. Now I need to know everything about Embryo. I do not know what it is - a person, place, or anything else ... But the job is received, and I need to perform.
