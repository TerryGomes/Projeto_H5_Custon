!Warehouse Keeper Valkon:

Yes, yes, yes! Superb! You will make an excellent addition to our guild, and I perceive a bright future in store for you.

Congratulations! You have successfully passed the Trial of the Guildsman, and I now award you the *Mark of Guildsman*. It will aid you when transfering to a higher class. Good luck!
