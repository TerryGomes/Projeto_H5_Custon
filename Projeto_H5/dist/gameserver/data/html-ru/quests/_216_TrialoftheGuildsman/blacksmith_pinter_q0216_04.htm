You think you can get the Amber Beads by yourself...? Oho! Indeed you are a Raider! I can tell you where to look.

There are giant ants living in the *Wastelands*, in the southern part of Gludio. They mine the Amber Beads, which are plentiful there. To get the beads you must kill the *work ants* not the ant soldiers, understand? You will be able to collect faster by casting *Spoil*.

We will need about 20 beads to make Journeyman Deco Beads. However I can also use them in my work, I would be very grateful if you brought back *70*. I will give your order top priority. Quite a deal, huh?
