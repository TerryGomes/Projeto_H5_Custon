Hmmph. With talk like that, you won't last very long or rise very high here, my friend. My advice is to learn to fake sincerity, and everything else will be easy. Understood?

In any case, congratulations are in order. You have successfully passed the Trial of the Guildsman, and I now award you the *Mark of Guildsman*. It will aid you when transfering to a higher class. Good luck!
