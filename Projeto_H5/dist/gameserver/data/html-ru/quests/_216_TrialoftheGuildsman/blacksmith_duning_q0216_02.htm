!Blacksmith Duning:

We're both Dwarves, we should stick together, right? You mustn't repeat what I am about to tell you. I have lost all of my *30 keys* to the *Breca Orc* beggars. If word got out about this my reputation with the guild would be destroyed!

Please my young friend, could you help me this once? Please find the keys for me, it doesn't matter what condition they are in! Can I count on you?
