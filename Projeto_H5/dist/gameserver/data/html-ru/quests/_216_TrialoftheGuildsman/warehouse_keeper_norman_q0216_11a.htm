!Warehouse Keeper Norman:

First of all we need some *Gray Bone Powder* to use as the abrasive. You can get it from undead monsters such as *ghouls* or *strains*. I heard that there are plenty in the execution place of Dion.

And I also need a *Granite Whetstone* which is for processing the surface of the jewel... It would be best if you can find a piece of *granite golem*!

Other necessary things would be... The *Red Pigment*! Which you can get from the *dead seeker* bat in the Execution Ground. Last, we need some *Braided Yarn*. That you can get by hunting the *silenos* in Giran...

Did you memorize everything? Don't forget it this time.
