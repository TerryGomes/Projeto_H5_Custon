!Blacksmith Pinter:

You think you can get the Amber Beads by yourself?  Oho! You are not even a Raider! Oh, well, if you want to try I can tell you where to find them..

There are giant ants living in the *Wastelands*, in the southern part of Gludio. They mine the Amber Beads which are plentiful in that place. To get the beads you must kill the *work ants* instead of ant soldiers, got it?

We need about 20 beads to make Journeyman Decoration Beads. However, I also use them in my work, it would be nice if you brought back *70*. I will give your order top priority. So how about it, a good deal, no?

Oh yes! And take this *recipe*. It will help you.
