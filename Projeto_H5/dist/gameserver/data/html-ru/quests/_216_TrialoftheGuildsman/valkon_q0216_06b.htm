!Warehouse Keeper Valkon:

Hmm... What nerves you've got. Hints... Well, yes I just came across one.

I heard that Altran used to be a kind man, but perhaps because of his aging, he seems to be a bit fastidious these days. Some say that it is because of the arthritis... Whatever the reason may be, he grumbles a great deal these days...

Perhaps he may be pleased to receive a mandragora berry which they say it is helpful to arthritis.
