!Blacksmith Altran:

Back in the old days I had to memorize hundreds of formulas.  Now they all have recipes!  What will they think of next?

OK, here is the *recipe for making a Journeyman Ring*. Let me see...

[Production of Journeyman Ring]

[Materials] 1 Journeyman Gem, 1 Journeyman Deco Bead, 1 Steel, 10 Varnish, 10 Grade D Crystals

[Result] 1 Journeyman Ring

Steel and Varnish are commonly used and easily found. Journeyman Gems and Journeyman Decon Beads are harder to find, however.
