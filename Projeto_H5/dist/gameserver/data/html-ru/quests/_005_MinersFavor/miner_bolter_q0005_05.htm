!Miner Bolter:

Argh! May your beard become as sparse as a Gremlin's whiskers, you empty-headed wastrel! You are as forgetful as Brunon...

First, stop by the Weapons and Armor Shop and get a sack of Boom-boom Powder from *Trader Shari*.

Then go to the General Store and get a pair of Mining Boots from *Trader Garita*.

After that, go to the Warehouse and get us a case of Redstone Beer from *Warehouse Chief Reed*.

Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from *Blacksmith Brunon*.
