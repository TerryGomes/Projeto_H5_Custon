!Miner Bolter:

Here's a list of the supplies we need. Let's see...

Ah! First, stop by the Weapons and Armor Shop and get a sack of Boom-boom Powder from *Trader Shari*.

Then go to the General Store and get a pair of Mining Boots from *Trader Garita*.

After that, go to the Warehouse and get us a case of Redstone Beer from *Warehouse Chief Reed*.

Finally, pick up a Miner's Pick from *Blacksmith Brunon*.

Brunon has become very absent-minded, so take these -- just in case you need to shock him back to reality!
