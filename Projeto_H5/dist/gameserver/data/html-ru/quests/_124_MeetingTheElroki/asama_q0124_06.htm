!Asamah:

Unfortunately, all I could discover was when the medicine existed. So I asked the shaman Karakawei to summon the spirits of the Elrokians of that time and ask them where the medicine is.

Karakawei knew the risks, but for my sake he attempted to summon our ancestors' spirits. For many days, his efforts were in vain, but finally he was able to contact a spirit who possessed knowledge of the medicine's whereabouts. Since then we've been anxiously waiting for an adventurer with the courage and skill to recover it for us.

There is not a moment to spare! Please go straight to Karakawei -- you'll probably find him praying around the barracks. After you've obtained the medicine, please return to me at once. In the meantime, I will attempt to discover the cause of this illness while protecting my father from the riots.

May Shilen guard your steps!
