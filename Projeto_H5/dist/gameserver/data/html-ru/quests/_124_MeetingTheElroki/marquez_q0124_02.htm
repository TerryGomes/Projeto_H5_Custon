Do not judge the Primeval Isle by only looking at this wharf. It is a dangerous place where primitive dinosaurs hide in the thick jungle, waiting for weak ones like you to wander by unawares! I've seen many like you who came to a bad end here!

Exploring this island is not something to be done on a whim, mark my words. One day, when you are more experienced, you may be ready to explore its mysteries.
