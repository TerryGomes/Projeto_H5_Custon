Thank you! Then listen carefully.* I have received news of the Elrokian chief, Mushika,* the leader of his tribe.%%
In his youth, he ventured into the Lost Nest in search of relics that could shed light on his people's history. During that time, I led an expedition to the Lost Nest which nearly met with disaster. Only Mushika's intervention saved us, and he and I became good friends.%%
But I recently received a letter from him in which he tells me that he is dying from some disease. The pain must be unbearable, since it seems that his son Asamah had to finish the letter for him.%%
