The conflict between Humans and Elrokhians began when the explorers built this wharf and maintained a presence here.%%
Our two races are divided by differences in culture and language. What seems normal to one is often strange, even offensive, to the other. Despite my efforts to teach both sides to live together in harmony, misunderstandings are common. Blood has been spilled on more than one occasion, and the peace that now exist is fragile at best.%%
