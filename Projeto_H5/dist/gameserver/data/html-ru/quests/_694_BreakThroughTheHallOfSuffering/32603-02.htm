!Officer Tepios:

I will tell you about the area you will enter and what you must do there.

The Hall of Suffering consists of 5 consecutive rooms. Each room has a *Tumor of Death* guarded by various monsters.

You must *deactivate* this Tumor. Once you have done so, it will become a *Destroyed Tumor*.

Of course, the monsters will try to stop you. Once the Tumors in all 5 rooms are deactivated, you may proceed.

But I leave it up to you wherher to face the monsters or the Tumors first. Remember, even if you destroy the Tumor, the nearbly monsters won't simply disappear.
