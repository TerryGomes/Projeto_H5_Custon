!Secret Agent Collin:

Yes, magically transformed. You'll be visually indistinguishable from the priests. But as any spy worth his salt knows, there's more to a disguise than getting dressed into fancy rags. Gotta play the part too, move like them, talk like them, think like them.

Right, enough chat. Your first task will be to see the <font color="LEVEL">Frog King</font> at the nearby <font color="LEVEL">lake</font> and swindle him out of somethin' precious.

Think on your feet, act fast, and get out of there before they have your legs for lunch. Remember what I told you and keep your wits about you!

(The transformation will cancel all movement and speed related buffs.)
