!Secret Agent Collin:

Right, don't mess up this time. I need you to convince <font color="LEVEL">Kuta</font> to hand you over one of <font color="LEVEL">his possessions</font>. As soon as you have it, get back here and I'll assess your progress.

Remember: <font color="LEVEL">move fast, avoid water</font>. Go!
