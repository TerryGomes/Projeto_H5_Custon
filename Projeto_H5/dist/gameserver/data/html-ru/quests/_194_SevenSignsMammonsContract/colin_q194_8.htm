!Secret Agent Collin:

So you've conned a talking frog and an old lady, now comes the real test. I want you to speak to one of the <font color="LEVEL">adult villagers</font> here and get him to hand you one of <font color="LEVEL">their belongings</font>.

Do it and we'll be done with our trainin'. Fail and we'll know more work is needed.

Ready for the transformation?
