!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

We do--the <font color="LEVEL">Priests of Dawn</font> hold the page. One of our spies was able to find the document, but was discovered and killed before we could spirit him away.

I want you to go in his place, infiltrate the Priests of Dawn and steal the <font color="LEVEL">last page of that contract</font>. We'll train you up first, or rather <font color="LEVEL">Agent Collin</font> will.

You'll find him at <font color="LEVEL">Aden's South Entrance</font>. Take him this note else he'll tell you little more than the time of day.
