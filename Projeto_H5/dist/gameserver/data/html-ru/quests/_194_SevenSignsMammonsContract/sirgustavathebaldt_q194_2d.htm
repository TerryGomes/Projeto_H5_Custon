!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

No doubt, but time is not something we have to spare, my friend.

Now listen. Our agents have succeeded in gathering all but the last page of this contract. We believe this last page has the secret agreement penned in it, the one we seek to uncover.

We need help. We need someone to go and recover the last page.
