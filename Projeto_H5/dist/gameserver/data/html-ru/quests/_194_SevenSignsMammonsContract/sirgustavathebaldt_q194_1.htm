!Sir Gustav Athebaldt

Ready are you? Well then, let's get to it!

I'm sure you're full to the brim with questions, but allow me first to tell you a short story. My tale should answer your questions before they are asked, give you context to what you have already witnessed, and show you your path if you are to continue working with the Order of the Dawn.

That, I assume, is a given?
