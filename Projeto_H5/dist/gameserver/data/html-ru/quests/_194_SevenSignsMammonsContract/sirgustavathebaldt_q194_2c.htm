!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

There is a problem though. Others have found out about the contract and have far less qualms as to how they obtain the thing.

We believe that monster you fought with Priest Cain is one of the agents searching for the document, though many questions still remain. Is it working alone? What does it intend on doing with the contract once it has it?
