!Frog King:

Ribbit! What happened to you, servant? Much smarter than when I ribbiting sent you! Eat a smart-fly or something? Rib-ribbit!

Very well, I'll send her the Blue Bead, my most treasured ribbiting possession. She can't say no to such a beauty!

Take this and ribbiting give it to her! See what she says, and come back to me with the good news! Rib-rib-ribbit!
