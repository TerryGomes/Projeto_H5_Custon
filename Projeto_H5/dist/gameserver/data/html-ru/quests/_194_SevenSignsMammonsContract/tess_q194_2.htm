!Grandma Tess:

Oh I see! Well then let me get you some of the candy I made. It's not going to fill you right up, but should keep you going until supper.

Hmm... I'll tell you what. How about I give you all the candy I made, and you hand it out to the others kids?

Now hurry back to your friends, hear? I want you all back before dark or I'll have to come looking for you again. And with my back....
