Nightshade must be fertilized by zombie dust. It is a component made by drying the skin of corpses and pounding them into dust. This is said to be more effective when it is made by older corpses. I sought the advice of Tetrarch Vellior, who said that he collects the skin of the undead to make zombie dust.

If you go to the *Marshlands*, southwest of the village, the *marsh zombies* that were massacred by our race a long time ago haunt the grounds. Please collect their skin. I will pay you for *5 Zombie's Skins*.
