<html><body>[Dark Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
When a Dark Fighter reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. After successful completion of the quest and attainment of level 20, the character can transfer to one of two classes: Palus Knight or Assassin. After a class transfer, a character's skills become more diverse, powerful and specialized. In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Palus Knight</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Master Virgil</font>. <br>
In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Assassin</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Triskel</font>. Both are in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio Castle Town</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
