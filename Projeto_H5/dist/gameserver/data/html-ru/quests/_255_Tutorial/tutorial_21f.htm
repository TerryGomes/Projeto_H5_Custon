<html><body>[Dwarven Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
When a Dwarven Fighter reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. After successful completion of the quest and attainment of level 20, the character can transfer to one of two classes: Scavenger or Artisan. After a class transfer, a character's skills become more diverse, powerful and specialized. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Scavenger</font> you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Collector Pippi</font>. <br>
In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Artisan</font> you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Silvera</font>. <br>
Both are in the <font color="LEVEL">Dwarven Village</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
