<html><body>[Fate's Whisper]:<br>
I hear a soft voice whisper in my ear;<br><br>
"...the wind never sleeps,<br>
The waves of change are turning. <br>
The paths of darkness and light intersect,<br>
A new song of dawn begins..."<br><br>
"Listen to the call of fate.  <br>
You, who will shape the face of the continent!<br>
Go see Maestro Reorin...<br>
Master Smith of the Platinum race awaits you in the land of Oren..."<br><br>
"...and,<br>
in the bottomless pit of despair, let new hope flower,<br>
and arm yourself anew with the well-trained flames of eternal torment..."<br>
