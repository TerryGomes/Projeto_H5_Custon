<html><body>[Orc Fighter Class Transfer]:<br>
When an Orc Fighter reaches level 19, the character is allowed to undertake a quest for class transfer. Upon successful completion of the quest and attainment of level 20, the character can transfer to one of two classes: Orc Raider or Monk. After a class transfer, a character's skills become more diverse, powerful and specialized. <br>
In order to become an <font color="LEVEL">Orc Raider</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Prefect Karukia</font>. <br>
In order to become a <font color="LEVEL">Monk</font>, you must meet with <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu</font>. <br>
Both are in the <font color="LEVEL">Orc Village</font>. Please consider your options carefully and then go see the appropriate NPC.<br>
