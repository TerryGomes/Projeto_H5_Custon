!Samed:

You have returned already? I see you have not found the items I asked you for. I am very disappointed ...

I will explain to you again, so listen carefully. Go to the *Ruins of Despair* or the *Ruins of Agony* and find me the *corpse pieces* of the undead and I will give you an ample reward. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Curtis or Guard Babenco.
