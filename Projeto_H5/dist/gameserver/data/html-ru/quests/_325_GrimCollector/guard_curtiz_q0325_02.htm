!Guard Curtis:

If you are thinking of going to the ruins, I can give you an errand that you will find rewarding. Just recently, I spoke with *Samed*, who lives near the edge of the village ... He asked me to refer a few skilled friends to him, when guards or mercenary soldier troops were dispatched near the ruins.

I myself have helped him out a few times. The job is a little unpleasant, but ... the pay is good. What do you say, do you want to give it a try?
