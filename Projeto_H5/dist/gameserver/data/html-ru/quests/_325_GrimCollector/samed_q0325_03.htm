Collect corpse pieces from the *Ruins of Despair* or the *Ruins of Agony.* If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Curtis or Guard Babenco. From the *zombies*, bring their *head, heart, and liver*. From the *skeletons*, bring the *skull, spine, rib, arm bone, and thigh bone*.

I also need bone pieces, but actually I need a *complete skeleton* of Human form more. Unfortunately, when you fight with the undead, their body shatters so it will be impossible to find a complete skeleton. But the person that took this job before you found one somehow.

Ah, and don't bring back anything from the spartoi. Spartoi are 'his' minions... It is better not to make him angry.
