!Guard Curtis:

Go to *Samed* to get all the details. If you meet him, tell him that Curtis sent you. Then he'll know I sent you and will give you the job.

I wouldn't tell anyone you are working for Samed. So I hope you won't tell anyone that you received the job from me. Do you understand what I'm saying?
