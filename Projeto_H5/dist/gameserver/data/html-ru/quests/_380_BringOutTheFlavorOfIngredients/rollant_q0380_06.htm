!Magister Rollant:

You haven't brought all the ingredients. Please bring me *Ritron Fruit* from *Dire Wolves*, *Moon Flowers* from *Kadif Werewolves*, *Giant Mist Leech Fluids* and *Antidote*. Bring them to me and I'll make you the best dessert ever made... Even Magister Mirien, known as the magician of flavor, has never tasted it!
