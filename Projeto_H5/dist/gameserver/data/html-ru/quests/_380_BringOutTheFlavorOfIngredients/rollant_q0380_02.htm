!Magister Rollant:

Are you  interested in the culinary arts? There are many excellent food ingredients here at Dion Castle. The local people have a passion for cooking and hold a culinary competition every month.

Many people think of this place as a chef's paradise, but I'm not completely satisfied. Although the correct cooking process is vital to the creation of fine foods, there is something missing.... The other chefs don't seem to notice this, or else they simply don't want to put in the time and effort to obtain new ingredients.
