!Priest Flauron:

Who comes calling? Oh, you can't want to go down this pathway. Yes, it leads to our temple, but it's awfully dangerous if you're not authorized. Unwelcome visitors often disappear down that path, never to been seen again. Unwise, tragically unwise!%%
I see no authorization documents on you, so no, you cannot pass there safely. Although we* sometimes receive visitors ...* that would be authorized, I suppose, under certain circumstances.
