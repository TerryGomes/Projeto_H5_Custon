!Priest Eliyah:

Those heathens occasionally even perform* Human sacrifices* in their so-called Temple! They seem to enjoy that part of their religion more than any other... And that, my child, is your way into the Temple!* You'll be their human sacrifice*! Of course, I realize that this is a very dangerous way to get in, but these are desperate times... And besides, they've been having a hard time finding Humans to sacrifice!%%
Now, let's talk about how you're going to do this... Before I get started, are you sure you want to do this?
