!Priest Eliyah:

*Priest Flauron in Rune Township* is in charge of finding Human sacrifices for the Pagans. Go speak with him and tell him that you're thinking about becoming a Pagan... He'll offer to let you visit the Temple, and will give you what he'll claim is an entrance pass. It's actually a *Sacrifice Mark*! It will get you inside the Temple easily enough, but once you're inside those lunatics will set upon you with spears and knives! There's no way that you could stand against this onslaught alone...

Many people have been deceived by Flauron this way and have ended up as live sacrifices themselves. You should probably take some trusted comrades with you. I've heard that the Pagans have a strange technique for scattering the forces of outsiders so be very careful!
