!Kelleyia:

By the looks of you, I can tell you aren't one of the locals... given the fact you can still stand up straight and don't look like you are about to pass out.

I'm a talent scout and I'm looking for the best of the best in Aden. Apparently, I made a mistake coming here first.

You look like you know your way around a weapon. Want to test your skills?
