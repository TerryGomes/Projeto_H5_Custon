!Kelleyia:

Yes... someone who searches for someone who has talent.Â Not too bright are you. My boss, who wishes to remain nameless, has asked me to find adventurers who can demonstrate excellent combat skills. Those who are great are rewarded with greatness. Those who are horrible are rewarded with shame.
