!Kelleyia:

Really... you really want me to go over this again? It is simple. Find an <font color="LEVEL">Alpine Kookaburra, Alpine Cougar, Alpine Buffalo, or Alpine Grendel</font> and feed it on spice until it grows into an adult. Speak to my associate over here to purchase spice.

Once it is an adult, kill it trying to score as many <font color="LEVEL">Over-hits and Critical Over-hits</font> as possible.

The limit is <font color="LEVEL">10 of each</font> type of animal. That's a total of 40 if you can't add. If you can't score an Over-hit before killing an animal, you'll have to wait until tomorrow to try again.

Do you think you can follow these directions?
