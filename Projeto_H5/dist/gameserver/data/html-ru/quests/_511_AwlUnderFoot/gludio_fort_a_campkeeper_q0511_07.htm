!Detention Camp Warden:

Once there was a major fight between the evil beings and the keepers of this dungeon camp.

What a battle...

Both sides suffered enormous casualties.

But at least the conflict seems to have kept many of the lower level monsters in check.

However, the strongest of the creatures have formed 3 groups and are regularly marauding through the camp.

Judging from their recent activity, they're planning something, that's for sure.

Your task will be to eliminate the *3 groups* so that the remaining evil creatures in the camp can be driven out. Kill the General Monster of the *last group*, and bring back the *Camp Prisoner Leader's Sign*.

In return, I'll give you the Knight's Epaulette, which you can exchange for the fortress clan supply.

Oh, one last thing:

the prisoner leaders we've identified so far are *Brand the Exile, General Koenig and Gerg the Hunter*.

I can admit you to the dungeon of the fortress right now.

Please do me this favor!
