!Detention Camp Warden:

I am the Detention Camp Warden of this fortress. This underground monster camp was recently discovered.

I know that other fortresses also have camps like this. My duty is to keep this dungeon camp area safe.

After all, it would hardly be desirable to have monsters appearing and disappearing in the dungeon of a fortress, would it?

Unfortunately, we simply can't handle this job alone.

We need help from the clan members.

We'll compensate you for your help, naturally.
