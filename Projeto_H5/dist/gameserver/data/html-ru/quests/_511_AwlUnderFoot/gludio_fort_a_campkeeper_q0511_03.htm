!Detention Camp Warden:

Thank you for volunteering to help!

The dungeon monster camp in this fortress was only recently discovered.

Apparently, some long-dead emperor created this place years and years ago in order to breed the monsters for the sake of magical experimentation.

Another rumor says that this place was used as a prison for criminals and evil creatures.

Whatever the real reason for its existence, the entrance had been hidden for a very long time.

Since you've volunteered your services, your task will be to eliminate *Brand the Exile, Commander Koenig and Gerg the Hunter*, creatures that are members of the last of *three small groups* in the *fortress dungeon* and obtain the *sign of the camp prisoner's leader*.
