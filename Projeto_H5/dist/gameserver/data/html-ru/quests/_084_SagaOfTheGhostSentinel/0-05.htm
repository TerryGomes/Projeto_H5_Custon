!Hunter Guild President Bernard:

Sagittarius's bow, the symbol of our guild, was stolen.%%
During the day, it's on display, but at night, I keep it close at hand.%%
I was delayed putting it in the safe for just a minute while counting my new coins.%%
This must be a conspiracy against me.%%
Your reputation is growing, I would appreciate your help.
