I've met the thief you mentioned.%%
Don't misunderstand me, I wouldn't have anything to do with a thief like him!%%
He asked me to relay a message.%%
He said, "Take this to the stone tablet south of the Tower of Insolence. You'll find me there."%%
You'd better watch out for this thief! I tried to trick him out of The Bow and I almost got killed! He's very tough!
