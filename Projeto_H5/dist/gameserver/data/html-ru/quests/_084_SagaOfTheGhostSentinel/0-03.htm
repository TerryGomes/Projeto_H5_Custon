!Hunters Guild President Bernard:

Thank you so much!%%
You'll be well-rewarded if you solve this problem.%%
It's only fair, right? Ha!%%
Whoever stole my bow was a very cunning thief. He took it right from under my nose!%%
I'll wager that Information Broker Grimst knows about this robbery. You should ask him for the details.%%
Oh, by the way, this book was found at the scene of the crime.%%
You should get going!
