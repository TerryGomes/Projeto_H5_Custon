Chaos... That's right. That's the best word I can use to describe it...<br>
It was like something ripped a hole in reality itself. Both captain and crew were sucked in...<br>
I later heared that power is called Kamaloka or Pailaka or somesuch. They say that it will engulf the entire world.<br>
That's when my nightmares came... Soon after closing my eyes, I dream of strenge and horrible monsters who forture me until I wake again. Ah, but the real problem was something else... Do you know what it is?<br>
