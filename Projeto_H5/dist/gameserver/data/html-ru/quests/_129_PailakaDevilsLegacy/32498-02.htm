Uh... I suppose I can talk about Lematan's Fleet with someone of your skill and expirience...<br>
Lemetan was a pirate who lusted adter Jaken's treasure... But instead of making him rich, it brought him only evil.<br>
As soon as he touched the treasure, a powerful curse was cast about Lematan. He and his men were transformed into something...indescribable.<br>
and that wasn't the end of it. An unnatural darkness, blacker than black, suddenly arose and swallowed thm all. It was like looking into the pit of chaos itself...<br>
