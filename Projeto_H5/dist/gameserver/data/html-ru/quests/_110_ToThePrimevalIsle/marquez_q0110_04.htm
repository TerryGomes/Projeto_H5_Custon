Ha ha! Thank you for saying so. But my aching body knows the truth; those days have ended for me. Lately I have at least tried to pass my knowledge on to younger adventurers by writing an account of my experiences on the island.

I started by recounting both my own personal experiences and various stories I learned from the natives. But then I heard of a ancient book that recounts the history of Primeval Isle, and I have searched for it for years now without success. I was ready to give up...until Clark sent me a message saying that he found it. And here it is...

I see by your expression that you are as curious about its contents as I am! The ancient language is no doubt foreign to you, but I can translate a few passages if you are interested in hearing them. Shall I do so?
