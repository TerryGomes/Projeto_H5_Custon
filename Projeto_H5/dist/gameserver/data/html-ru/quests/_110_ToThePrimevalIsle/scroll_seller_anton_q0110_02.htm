!Spellbook Seller Anton:

While clearing out the library's underground warehouse one day, I discovered a very old, very worn-out book filled with snatches of some unkown ancient language. I have tried to translate it without success, but I recently learned that this book is very valuable. I am looking for an adventurer who can transport it to Primeval Isle, but I don't think that you're the right person for the job. No offense! I know it sounds like an easy task, but the island is a place filled with peril. I need someone with more...experience to undertake this mission.
