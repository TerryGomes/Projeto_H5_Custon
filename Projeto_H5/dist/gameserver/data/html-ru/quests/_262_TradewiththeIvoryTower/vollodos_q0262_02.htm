!Trader Vollodos:

I travel to *Oren's Ivory Tower* once or twice a year. What kind of place is the Ivory Tower of Oren, you ask? It is the headquarters of Mystics, as well as an educational institute, and a place where Mystics gather. You can get useful magic potions and materials from the Traders or Mystics of the Ivory Tower.

A few of the Ivory Tower Mystics have asked me to bring them magic materials that can only be found in our Dark Forest. They pay handsomely for the materials that I bring them, and it occurred to me that this might be the beginning of a good business. So I plan to go into it a bit deeper.

During my last visit I noticed that there were many Mystics looking for *mushroom spores*. These spores can only be obtained from the *green fungus* or the *blood fungus* that appear in our Dark Forest. The fungi are strange, mushroom-shaped life forms that have formed from the fermented spores carried over from the Sea of Spores. It is dangerous for a mere businessman like myself to face the fungi alone. Which brings me to my point. Do you think you could go and get me some? I will pay you well for them.
