!Blacksmith Hilda:

Very well, then. Defeat the *monsters in the Gods' Forge*, collect the flames you find there, and bring them to Vulcan. He's mad, but he's a canny blacksmith; he'll give you an S-grade weapon recipe if you can bring him *1000 flames*.

You may have heard tell of Vulcan's younger brother *Rooney*. No? Well, he's as mad as his brother is, and perhaps even cannier as a blacksmith. He's a wandering lad, but he has a lot of different S-grade weapon recipes. *Give Rooney 1200 flames, and he'll reward you with an S-grade weapon recipe.* If you can find him in his wanderings, it might be a good idea for you to meet with him too.
