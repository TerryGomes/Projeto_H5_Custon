!Blacksmith Hilda:

Ho, there! I'm Hilda the Blacksmith, and if you want good, solid work done, there's none better here.

Don't pay any attention to the claims of that crackpot *Vulcan*. He's mad through and through. Fire is his obsession â€” he's forever searching for ways to make fire hotter and fiercer. I care for my fire, as does any competent blacksmith, but there are limits. Anyway, he won't live long enough to help you with anything; he's in the habit of venturing into the *Forge of the Gods*, and one day its dangers will claim him - and his eternal fire too!

I've heard he is looking for adventurers to help him collect flames, but take my advice: leave that job to tougher adventurers, or wait until you yourselves are tougher. If you accompany him now, you'll die right alongside him.
