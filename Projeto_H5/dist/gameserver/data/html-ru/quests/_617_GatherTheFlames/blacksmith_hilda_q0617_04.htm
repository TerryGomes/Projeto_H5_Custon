!Blacksmith Hilda:

So you met with Vulcan, did you?  Did he give you an earful of his madness?  Well, he's mad about flame, but the rewards he offers are real. Defeat the *monsters in the Gods' Forge*, collect the flames you find, and go to him; he will give you an S-grade weapon recipe if you bring him *1000 flames*.%% If you gather even more flames, you might see about meeting Vulcan's younger brother *Rooney*.  He's as mad as his brother, and he's engaged in the same quest.  *Bring him 1200 flames and he will give you an S-grade weapon recipe.*. Rooney wanders from here to there, so he's not easy to find...but it might be worth your while to deal with him.
