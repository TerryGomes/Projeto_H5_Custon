!Magister Nell:

Well, if I only needed them for my research, these would be enough. But a wiseman taught me all about these gemstones.

He said that he needed them, and asked me to collect the fragments for him.

At that time the trader Katerina of Talking Island was there. She is also collecting gemstones.

When she gives the gemstones to the wiseman, I also want to give at least the same quantity to him. You see, I am a magister... I can't be outdone by a trader like Katerina. Do you understand?

Please do this for me. Collect more gemstones so that I can give them to the wiseman.
