!Magister Nell:

This won't be easy. The spirits that live in the Forgotten Temple are very strong. You will need help. You can get *Flare Shards* from *Lakin salamanders, Salamander Rowins and Death Fires*. *Freezing Shards* can be obtained from *the Lakin Undine, the Rowin Undine and the Roxide*. Please bring me *50 of each type*.
