Amazing! You've brought them! They must have been very heavy! Please put them down here. Be very, very careful!

Thank you for your hard work. Here is your reward. These fragments are kind of small. Now, I can meet Les with confidence. He contacted me some time ago...

Anyway, thank you for your help. If possible, please come and help me again sometime, and bring some friends to help you! Take care!
