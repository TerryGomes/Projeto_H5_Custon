!Mercenary Captain Pierce:

Great fighting. Take a rest for the moment.

Ah, take this with you. This is a reward for bringing 100 stakato claws. It is paid to mercenaries as an allowance. Take it to the Mercenary Supplier and exchange it with various things. If you need anything, go see Abercrombie anytime!
