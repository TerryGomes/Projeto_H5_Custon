The Black Lion undoubtedly rewards its members according to skill and performance. You will be paid according to the number of enemies you kill. One condition, though, you must take the *badge of ranking* as a token of proof.

ol mahum use badges in the shape of a cross, taking after the foreign troops of Gracia. Soldiers have red, sergeants have blue, and officers have black cross badges. Naturally, you will receive a higher award depending on the rank of the ol mahum you killed.

If you display great skills on the battlefield, you can become an official member of the Black Lions. For this, you must gather *100 badges of the ol mahum* to prove your skills.

Currently, ol mahum are camping in the *abandoned camp*. If you don't know how to get there, ask Guard Lynchuss. Wonderful! Now get ready to depart, my comrade. Forward to victory!
