!Leopold:

Welcome, comrade of the sword! Seeing you safely return from the scene of battle gives me great joy. The badges of the enemy in your hand show that the goddess of victory has smiled upon you.

I received a letter that the brothers of the second platoon, who were dispatched to the south part of Gludio, will return later than planned. I will need more of your services for the time being.
