Railroad Worker Obi:

Oh, you brought the book! Yes, I remember now!
The Sky Wagon was planed by the giants of the Age of Titans! After they were extinct, the Dwarves proceeded with the plan as if it were theri own!
But one the Dwarf King was dead and the Elders started governing the Dwarves, the plan was shelved because of other Guild's pressure.
Those were sad days indeed! So much potential income gone to waste...
This hammer comes from that time! So... The ghost told you to bring me this hammer?
