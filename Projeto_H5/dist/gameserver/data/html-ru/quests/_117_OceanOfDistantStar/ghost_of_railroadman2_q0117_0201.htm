!Ghost of the Ancient Railroad Engineer:

...Hm? Ah, sorry, I forgot what I was saying. Don't be alarmed, I am a ghost. Oh, you can tell? Yes, I guess you could, come to think of it. The translucency and the echoing voice are, pardon the expression, dead giveaways. Well, I'm stuck in this place because I lost my tools... a terrible error for an engineer to make.
I think I might have left it somewhere in this railroad station. I recall a *hammer with engravings on the handle.* Do you think you can find it for me?
I think that *any railroad worker* would probably know where it is.
