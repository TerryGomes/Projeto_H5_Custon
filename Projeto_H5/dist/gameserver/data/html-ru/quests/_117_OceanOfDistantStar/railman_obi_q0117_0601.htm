!Railroad Worker Obi:

Hmmmm...? A hammer? Let me see...
What? This is really old! I 'haven't seen this kind of hammer in a long time!
So, this pillar, I'm sure you know, stands for our Gray Pillar Guild. And the star that is connected to this column, you see the two lines between them?
These lines symbolize the railroad. Basically, it means, *the railroad that reaches the stars and the Sky Wagon that runs on it. They actually had plans for one back then!*
