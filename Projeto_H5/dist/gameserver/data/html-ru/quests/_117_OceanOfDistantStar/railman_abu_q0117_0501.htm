!Railroad Worker Abey:

Is this the hammer? Wow! Look how rusty it is!
It seems familiar to me somehow. The Black Anvil doesn't use hammers this large, but our Grey Pillar Guild does!
These engravings are also of the Grey Pillar... But what are those strange stars?
Oh! I've got it! I think Obi might know! *Obi* has been working here for a long time. Why don't you go ask him about it?
