!Ghost of the Ancient Railroad Engineer:

Oh, wow! I can't hold it! I can't hold it!
I thought I could hold at least this hammer if nothing else! My own good hammer, and I have no hand to hold it...
Well, there is nothing I can do about it. My last hope is dashed. All I can do is wait here for Shilen's call...
One last favor, living ones could you *please go to the Trolley Ruins and meet my friend for me?* I am too weak to go see him now.

(The hammer falls right through his hand onto the ground. It breaks with a thud.)
