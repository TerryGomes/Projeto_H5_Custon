!Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:

As you can see, there are many ghosts here who once were Dwarves. We worked to a common purpose: the dream of bulding an air trolley. We wanted to visit the Sea of Stars and the Palace of the Gods...
But the Giants left, and we died one by one here. We refused Shilien's call in favor of our own ambition, but in the end, we failed.
