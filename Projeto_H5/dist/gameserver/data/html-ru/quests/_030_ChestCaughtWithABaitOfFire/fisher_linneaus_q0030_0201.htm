!Fishermen's Guild Member Linneus:

I think this is my client's *red treasure box*.
It contains the musical score that Mr. Rukal was looking for.
It has his name listed as the composer and lyricist.
If it is anything like his other works, it's wonderfully powerful music!
Take it to Mr. Rukal in Dion Castle Town.
