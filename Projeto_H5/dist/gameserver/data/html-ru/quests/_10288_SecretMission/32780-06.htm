Aquilani:

Sorry creature, I am not able to teleport you now. Do not test me on this, it is merely the way of things. Bring Brother Dominic's letter to Greymore in the Monastery. He will be between the 1st and 2nd floor.

As I told you before, once you have completed that task, I shall henceforth be able to teleport you directly to his location.
