Priest Dominic:

It's time plans were put into motion, yes, it's time those silent sycophants saw the truth of things, time for you to finally earn the right to be in my presence as well. I've got a task for you, yes if you're willing, there's something that needs being done and you will be rewarded with more than my mere respect.
