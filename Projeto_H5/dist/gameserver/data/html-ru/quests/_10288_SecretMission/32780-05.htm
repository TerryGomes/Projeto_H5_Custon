Aquilani:

Good. To find Greymore, you must enter the Monastery of Silence. Greymore studies his craft in a room in-between the 1st and 2nd floor there.

Bring him this letter, and then perhaps you will take part in the next step. I will also be able to teleport you directly to his location, once I am able to sense his presence in you.
