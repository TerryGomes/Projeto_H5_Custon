!Katenar:

Ah...

If only time permitted, I would like to tell you everything...

But it does not, unfortunately, and even now time is growing short. Are you familiar with the word *"Spicula?"* Go ask one of my brethren, *Harkilgamed* about it and listen to his reply...

I can speak no more -- I must disappear now. Remember: *Spicula Kamael*

You will find Harkilgamed hiding in the *Valley of Saints*.
