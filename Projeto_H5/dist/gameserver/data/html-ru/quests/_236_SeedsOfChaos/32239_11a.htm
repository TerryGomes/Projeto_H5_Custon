!Mother Nornil:

The seed of chaos planted in your very being is what allows you to live according to your own will than being the clave of fate.

That is freedom indeed...

Your will cannot be manipulated nor controlled; it rebels against the old order.

Liberate it and you will be free of the shackles of fate. Perhaps then you will be able to forge a new path...
