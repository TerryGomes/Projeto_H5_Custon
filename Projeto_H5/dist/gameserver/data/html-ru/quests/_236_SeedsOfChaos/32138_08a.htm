!Heirarch Kekropus:

The goal of the journey...

As I told you before, I wanted to know about our fate...

Our 3 great heroes, the Spicula of old, for all their skill are incapable of becoming anything other than what they are.

There can be no improvement, no change. That is what we were made to be, Kamael... and that is the barrier that keeps us from our true fate.
