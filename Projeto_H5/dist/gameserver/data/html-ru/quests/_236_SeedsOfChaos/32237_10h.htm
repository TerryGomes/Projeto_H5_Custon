!Rodenpicula:

I will now break one of the restraints imposed upon you.

This power was bequeathed to myself and Mother Nornil by the ancients. It will strengthen the *Seed of Chaos* within you.

Be warned, though -- I do not know what side effects it may have on your body. It is, after all, the essence of chaos.

I do know that it will definitely help you to break through the limitations that you sense. Do you wish to undergo the procedure?
