!Heirarch Kekropus:

On the other hand, we Kamael are limited in our birth and destiny.

We may only wield the sword; we do not have a god so we cannot use holy powers, nor can we sing the song of magic...

You younger Kamael have a few more options, but not many. Why is it that only the women have the ability to protect, while only the men have the ability to wield a sword?
