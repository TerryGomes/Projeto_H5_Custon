!Mother Nornil:

Great one...

I remember your parents.

I remember your birth.

I remember when you left these shores for the Outer World.

And I remember when you returned to this island of ours.

Many before you refused to walk this path.

But you are unafraid to step boldy into the dangerous and unclear future. Truly you are Kamael of the Kamael!
