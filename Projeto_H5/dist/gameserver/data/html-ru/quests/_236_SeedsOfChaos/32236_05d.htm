Yes. We do not have a creator god. Surprised?

I will tell you more, but this is too public a place, with too many listening ears nearby.

And we must eliminate those pesky Einhasad followers over there. Will you help me? Were I to do it personally, high-level angels -- or even demi-god level angels --  would sense my interference and might appear. You, on the other hand, can act with impunity. Defeat them and we will speak again afterward.
