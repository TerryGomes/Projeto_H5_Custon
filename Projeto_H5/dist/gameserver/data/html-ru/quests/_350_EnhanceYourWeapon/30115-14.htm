It seems that the most evil creatures in the Forest of Mirrors are the *Forest of Mirror ghosts, mirrors and Harit Lizardmen.*

Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
