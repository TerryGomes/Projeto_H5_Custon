!Master Gideon:

*After you have sapped the evil one's strength in battle, apply the crystal to his skin. His soul will be absorbed into the crystal. His mortal body is easily dispatched.* Each soul crystal can contain up to 10 souls. *A more precise explanation would be that it can contain up to 10 souls with regular usage. I will tell you the detailed story later when you bring back the soul crystal with 10 souls.*

Actually, collecting souls for the purpose of bestowing a weapon with a special power is not as easy as it sounds.
