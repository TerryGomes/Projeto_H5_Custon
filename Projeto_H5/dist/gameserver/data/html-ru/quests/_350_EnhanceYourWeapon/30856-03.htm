!Magister Winonin:

You must hurry and collect the souls of evil creatures in the soul crystal. You will find the evil ones in the *northern part of Oren, the Forest of Mirrors, the Cave of Giants, the Devastated Castle, the higher reaches of the Tower of Insolence, deep within the Lair of Antharas, Eva's Underwater Garden and Devil's Isle etc...*Take the crystal filled with souls to any blacksmith and he will enhance a weapon for you.

It is imperative that you build as much strength as possible to prepare yourself for the coming apocolypse. After growing each of your individual strength, if you put together all of your strengths, I think you will have enough force to fight against the approaching apocolypse. Then, next time we meet, I hope to see you stronger...
