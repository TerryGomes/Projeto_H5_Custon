!Magister Winonin:

It seems that *all of the evil creatures inhabiting Devil's Isle* are appropriate soul donors.

Remember that you cannot fill your crystal with the souls of weaker creatures. The crystal develops a refined taste and demands souls of greater evil. If you notice that your crystal has stopped absorbing souls, seek out creatures of greater evil.
