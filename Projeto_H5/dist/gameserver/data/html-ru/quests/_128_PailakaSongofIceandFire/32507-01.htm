That's the Spirite's Sword! It was forged long ago, a mightly dualsword made of fire and water. We use it to stabilize the energy of the temple. But now the situation is too far gone for the sword alone repair!

If the legends are to believed, something capable of strengthening the power of the Spirite's Sword should have appeared somewhere in the temple...
