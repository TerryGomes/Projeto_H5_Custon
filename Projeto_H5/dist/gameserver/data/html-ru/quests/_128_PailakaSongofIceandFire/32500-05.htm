!Inspector Sinai:

Please defeat those chaotic Spirites in the temple and restore stability.

You may use this Spirite's Sword, forged with both the power of water and fire. I know you will use it well.

Also, take this book written by the Elves who built this place -- it will tell you if something is wrong with the temple. When you enter the temple, follow the book's instructions.
