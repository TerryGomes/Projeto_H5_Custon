!Inspector Sinai:

If what you say is true, then you really did come here from another dimension!

There has been much speculation about other dimensions at our ivory Tower, but it seems you Ivory Tower is even more advanced..

If the cause of our troubles lies in the fissure of power in this dimension, you should be able to return to your dimension by stabilizing that fissure. What I mean is that if you can restore the balance of the Spirites' power here, you will be able to return to your world.

In any case, as an otherworlder you will surely be less affected by their power that we are. I place this task on your shoulders, my friend.
