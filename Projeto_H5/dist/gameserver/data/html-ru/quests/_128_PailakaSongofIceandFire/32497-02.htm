!Inspector Adler:

We inspectors were sent by the Ivory Tower to find more about that place.

We followed the flow of mana and traced the energy of Kamaloka to find likely spots.

At present, Pailaka has not affcted our reality, but who knows what may happen in time? It may even impact next year's harvest.

We discovered Pailaka in the Forgotten Temple close to here. If you are willing, I would like you to enter Pailaka and restore order. Will you do it?

*(You will be rewarded for your efforts. Vitality points will be granted to you immediately upon completing the quest. If you receive the reward while your Vitality Level is high, though, you may notice a slight reduction.)*
