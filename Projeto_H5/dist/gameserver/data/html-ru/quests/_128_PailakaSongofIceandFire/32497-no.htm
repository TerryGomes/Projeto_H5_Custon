!Inspector Adler:

Ah, you are the adventurer I spoke to before! Thanks to your efforts, the strange omens we feared seem to have disappeared. But I worry that Pailaka may be different from Kamaloka... True, it has not shown any signs of reappearing.

But I suspect this is not only Pailaka out there; perhaps in your adventures you will encounter another Pailaka somewhere else.
