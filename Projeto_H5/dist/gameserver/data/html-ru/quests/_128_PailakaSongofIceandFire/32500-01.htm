!Inspector Sinai:

Are you an adventurer? Hmm, finding an adventurer in a dangerous place like this...

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised! Still, I must admit I didn't expect to find your here.

Were you sent by the Adventurers Association? Or perhaps you found way here on your own? Ah, you look puzzled, my friend!
