!Inspector Adler:

We really don't know what you will encounter when you open the gateway to Pailaka. But as with Kamaloka, I suspect you will find an ally there willing to share information.

You should have no difficulty learning what you must do.

Of course, you don't know what kind of weapons to take with you.. Be careful, though -- *taking too many items may actually cause you to fail! Be careful*

And good luck!
