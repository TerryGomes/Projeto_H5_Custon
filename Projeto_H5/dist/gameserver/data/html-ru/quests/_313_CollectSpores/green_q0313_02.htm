Long ago, we Elves dwelled in a beautiful land east of the Elven Forest, beyond the mountains. But it was scarred by powerful dark magic used during the Human-Elven War. Now it is a poisonous expanse called the *Sea of Spores*.

Worse, that noxious area is slowly expanding, contaminating our forest and gradually eroding our magical defense field. Unless we can stop it, I fear it is only a matter of time before our village is destroyed. Perhaps when you are more experienced, my young friend, you will help us fight this menace.
