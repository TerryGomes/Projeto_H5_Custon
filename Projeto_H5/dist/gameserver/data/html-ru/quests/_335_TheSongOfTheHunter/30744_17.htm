!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

Oh, too bad. There aren't enough youngsters like you around these days... But if you have your mind made up, then I won't stop you... May all your wishes come true... Here is a small bonus for your work for the guild. You can use it for travel expenses. OK, well, this is goodbye. May the divine protection of the gods be with you...
