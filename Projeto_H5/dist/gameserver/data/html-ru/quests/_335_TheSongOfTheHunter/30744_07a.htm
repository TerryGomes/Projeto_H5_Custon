!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

We get dozens of hunting requests every day. You should speak to *Guild Member Tor* to find out what requests have currently come in. If there is a job that you like, you can accept it.

There is also the possibility of being hired by individuals. Recently *Cybellin* asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter. Would you care to meet him?
