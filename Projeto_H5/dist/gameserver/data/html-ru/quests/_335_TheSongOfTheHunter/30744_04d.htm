!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

You must bring the skin of the *Windsus Aleph*. It is a particularly strong and vicious black boar, native to the Giran region. To find him you must go to the *Death Pass* and hunt windsuses, eventually you will come across the Windsus Aleph. Your arrow must fly the moment you see its face!
