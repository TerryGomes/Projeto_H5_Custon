!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

You have obtained the items from the list! I must admit that I doubted you at first, but I stand corrected! Well, you certainly qualify as a hunter. I hereby bestow on you the 1-circle hunting license. Welcome to the guild, new hunting brother!

Now you are qualified to perform the various tasks that come to our Hunters Guild. Please go and ask *Guild Member Tor* over there for details.

Sometimes you will be assigned jobs by the guild, other times you'll be hired by individuals. Recently *Cybellin* asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter; would you like to meet him?
