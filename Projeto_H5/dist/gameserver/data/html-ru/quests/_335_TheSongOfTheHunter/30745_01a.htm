!Guild Member Tor:

Everyday our guild receives dozens of requests from people of all walks of life. From a village matron seeking to recover her dearly departed grandmother's brooch, to aristocrats seeking to plunder the treasure of ancient empires, they all come to us.

If you wish to accept a request, you must first obtain a hunting license. Guild member Grey can tell you more!
