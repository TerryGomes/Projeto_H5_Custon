!Guild Member Tor:

Everyday our guild receives dozens of requests from people of all walks of life. From a village matron seeking to recover her dearly departed grandmother's brooch, to aristocrats seeking to plunder the treasure of ancient empires, they all come to us.

Would you consider taking a request?
