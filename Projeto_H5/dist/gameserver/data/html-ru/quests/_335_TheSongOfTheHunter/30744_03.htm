!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

Did I hurt your feelings? Do you actually intend to try for the hunting license? If so, you must listen carefully to my words...

There are two types of hunters. Most hunters are 1-circle, but very skillful ones can obtain the 2-circle license by passing another test. Of course you must take the *1-circle license test* first.

To pass this test, you must bring back at least three of the items on this list.
