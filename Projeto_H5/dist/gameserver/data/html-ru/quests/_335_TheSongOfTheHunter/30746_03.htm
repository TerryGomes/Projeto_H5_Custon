Excellent! Take this *Blood Crystal* and dagger. Use the dagger to kill the evil *leto lizardmen* and *harit lizardmen* and the crystal to absorb their blood. This will raise the purity of the crystal above its current level of 1. Although this may seem quite simple, the process is not without risks. In addition to the danger posed by the lizardmen, there is a chance each time that the crystal will shatter, that is, the crystal will either increase in purity or be destroyed.

If you successfully raise the purity of the crystal and bring it to me, you shall receive a reward. The higher the level of purity, the greater your reward will be.

There are different theories as to why the crystal reacts like this to the blood of the lizardmen, possibly it is because these evil lizards are descended from dragons! You will find that certain grades of blood are very effective and others have no effect at all. This can only be determined by trial and error...

I have written down this task for you.
