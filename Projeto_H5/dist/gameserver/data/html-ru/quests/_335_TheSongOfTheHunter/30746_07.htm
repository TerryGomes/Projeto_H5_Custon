!Cybellin:

Fine, I will explain my request. You must increase the purity of a Blood Crystal and bring it to me. This is accomplished by dipping the crystal in the blood of *leto lizardmen* and *harit lizardmen* after you kill them with the dagger I gave you. If you are able to increase the crystal's purity to a level of 10 without destroying it, I will use my entire fortune to procure your reward!
