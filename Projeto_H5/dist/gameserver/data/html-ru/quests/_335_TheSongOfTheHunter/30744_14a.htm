!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

We get dozens of hunting requests every day. You should go to *Guild Member Tor* to find out what requests have currently come in. If there is an assignment that appeals to you, you can accept it.

There are also individuals who wish to hire hunters. Recently *Cybellin* asked me if I knew of a trustworthy hunter. Would you like to meet her?
