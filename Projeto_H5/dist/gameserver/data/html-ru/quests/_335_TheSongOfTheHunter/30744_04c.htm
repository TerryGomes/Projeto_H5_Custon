!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

You must kill the three evil outlaw Haka brothers and bring back their heads. They are named *Haka, Jakja and Marka*. They are prefects of the Breka orc tribe. They wantonly attack merchants' carriages, massacre citizens and set fire to their homes. There has been a bounty placed by on their heads by the Lord of Giran, therefore they have been laying low. But with the *Breka Orc Warriors* destroyed, they are bound to appear seeking revenge.
