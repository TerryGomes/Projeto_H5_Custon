!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

We get dozens of hunting requests every day. You should see *Guild Member Tor*, he will know  what requests have come in. If there is a job that you like, you can accept it.

Hunters are also hired by individuals, not just through the guild. Recently *Cybellin* asked me to introduce him to a trustworthy hunter. Would you care to meet him?
