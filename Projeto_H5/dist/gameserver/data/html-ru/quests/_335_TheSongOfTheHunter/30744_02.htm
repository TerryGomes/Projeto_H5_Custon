!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

Many aspire to join our guild. Many such as you only see the glamorous side of our profession.

Becoming a hunter is not an easy task. Only the very best and brightest are selected for membership in the Hunters Guild. A hunting license is only given to those who pass a very severe test.

Many give up before a week has passed. Does that sound like you?
