!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

You must gather *20 Karut Weeds*, used in the research of mages. The leto Lizardman mediums carry them. You may find the leto lizardmen in the southern part of Oren.

Gathering information about the items is a part of the test. Count yourself lucky to have received this valuable one-time hint!
