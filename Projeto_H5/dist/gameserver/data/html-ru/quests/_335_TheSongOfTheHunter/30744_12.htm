!Hunters Guild Member Grey:

Good work! I knew that you would complete the test without much trouble. Now you are a respectable 2-circle hunter. Congratulations!

Now you are qualified for more dangerous hunts. Go see Guild Member Tor.

Or perhaps you should visit Cybellin. He is still looking for a good hunter...
