The *drevanul* devils that came through the gates of hell during the last battle still live in the ruins of the Underground Fortress. Their leader is the drevanul *Kirunak*, also called the 'Blood Fiend'. Slay Kirunak and bring back his *skull* as proof of his death. Our revenge will then be complete.

May the brilliance of Einhasad's will protect you. Do not hesitate to raise high the sword of revenge!
