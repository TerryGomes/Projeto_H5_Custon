Ah, you have returned safely! On behalf of the Duda-Mara tribe, I thank you.

Now, Pa'agrio willing, I will finally discover the source of this curse. I do not know where this path will lead, but you have made it possible for us to follow it.

Here is the reward I promised you. Take it, and may the power of Pa'agrio guide your blade!
