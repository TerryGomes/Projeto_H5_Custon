!Trader Kunai:

As you know, creatures infected by the curse of the *Fiend Kasha* are everywhere, even just beyond the walls of our Orc Village.

We cannot simply wait and watch any longer -- we must discover the source of the curse. I wish to use the vision of the Duda-Mara tribe to divine it, but the task may be too difficult for me alone.

If you add your power to mine, however, we might succeed. Will you help me?
