On behalf of the Duda-Mara tribe, I thank you! There is much to do...

In order to discover the source of this curse, we require a medium. Once the Kasha Spider was our sacred symbol, and even though it has been corrupted by this fiend, it will still be suitable for our purposes.

Go to the *northern region of the Immortal Plateau*. There you must slay *Kasha Spiders, Kasha Fang Spiders and Kasha Blade Spiders* and bring me *30 Contaminated Kasha Spider Venom samples*. With them, I will be able to determine the source of this evil.

Naturally, you will be rewarded for your efforts.
