!Hierarch Kekropus:

Once we were created as weapons to oppose the gods, but now, I think we must shape our own destiny as a race.
I hope you are the one to free us from the constraints of the wheel of fate, the one who is able to see beyond limitations placed on us. I have faith in you, Soul Hound.
