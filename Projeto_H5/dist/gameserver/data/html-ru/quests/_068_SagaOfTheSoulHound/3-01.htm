!Head Blacksmith Lombert:

Why have you come to me? The Resonance Amulet? Ah! Wait a moment.%%
You are probably the owner of this item. Someone came to me some time ago with this broken lump and
asked me to repair it. Don't ask me about that person -- he came suddenly at night, so I never got a
clear look at him. Then he simply...disappeared. But he did say one thing before leaving: he told me
to fix it and give it to the one who came asking about it. Unfortunately, I've been able to figure
out how to fix it, but I lack some key ingredients. If you can get those for me, I can repair this.
