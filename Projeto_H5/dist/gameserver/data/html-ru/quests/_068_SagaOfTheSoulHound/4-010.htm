!Katenar:

His goal is to prevent the Kamael from regaining their rightful innate power. All the problems you've had stem from his efforts, in fact.%%
Here is what he dropped when he fled. Take it -- you'll need it.%%
Ah, I see that you're wondering whether you will achieve the same level of power I have if you release the final seal. But you already know who I am, don't you? That's not important right now, though -- this concerns more than individual power. It concerns the future of the Kamael, a future free from the artificial destinies imposed on mortals by the gods. You will be able to forge your own fate... Farewell, my friend.
