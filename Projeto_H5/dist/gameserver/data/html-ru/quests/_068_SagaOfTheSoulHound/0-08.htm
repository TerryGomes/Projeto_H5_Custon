!Hierarch Kekropus:

Once we were created as weapons to oppose the gods, but now, I think we must shape our own destiny as a race.
I hope you are the one to free us from the constraints of the wheel of fate, the one who is able to see beyond
limitations placed on us. I will watch your progress with great interest, but I think you are not yet ready
to become a Soul Hound. Come back to me when you are more experienced.
