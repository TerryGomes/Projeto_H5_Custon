To get the Resonance Amulet, there are two ways.%%
One way is to defeat the *Archon of Halisha,* who is located within *the Four Sepulchers.*%%
You must form a party to enter.%%
If that proves too difficult, defeat the followers of Halisha at the *Shrine of Loyalty.* By doing so, you can earn "tickets." Once you have acquired over *700* tickets, Halisha himself will appear. By the way, the creatures you must face are the *Grave Scarab, Scavenger Scarab, Grave Ant, Scavenger Ant, Shrine Knight and Stander.*
