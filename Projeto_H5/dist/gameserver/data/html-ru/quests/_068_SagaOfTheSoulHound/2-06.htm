!Warehouse Chief Mona:

Here is the item that was deposited. It's called a Resonance Amulet. I heard that it activates a
spell on the Tablet of Vision. I'm sure that you'll learn the rest once you find the Tablet and
experience it for yourself.%%
The first Tablet you'll need to find is in the area south of the Tower of Insolence. That's what
I've heard, anyway; it's no use asking about anything else.
