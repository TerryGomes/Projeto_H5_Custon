!Hierarch Kekropus:

I see. When you finally unbind all the seals and reclaim the power, come and find me. Then we will talk
about the fate that lies before you. Until then, there is a total of 6 seals that you are under. You
can unbind them at the Tablets of Vision using the Resonance Amulets. I can tell you the location of
the amulet you need to unbind the first seal. In anticipation of this situation, I prepared the Resonance
Amulet beforehand and have entrusted it to *Head Warehouse Keeper Mona in Goddard Castle Village.*
Go there and say that I sent you and you will receive the amulet.%%
This is all I can tell you now; you must discover the rest for yourself. But know that unbinding the seal is not
simply about power. It is about who is truly worthy to wield such power... I will be waiting for you to unbind
all the seals and return to me.%%
One final matter: I know you and your comrades have faced frequent attacks on this path. I can give you details
about your attackers that will enable you to better withstand their assaults...
