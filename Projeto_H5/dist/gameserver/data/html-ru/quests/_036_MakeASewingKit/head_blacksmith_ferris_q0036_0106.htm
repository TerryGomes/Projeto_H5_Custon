!Head Blacksmith Ferris:

What are you still doing here? Where is the *enchanted iron* you said you'd bring me? Remember? Find the *enchanted iron golem* in the vicinity of the Ivory Tower, peel off some of its skin and bring it to me! I'll need *five* pieces. That golem is a sturdy fellow, you'll really need to use all your strength!
