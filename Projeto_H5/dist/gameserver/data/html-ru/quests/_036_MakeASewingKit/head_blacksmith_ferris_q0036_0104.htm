!Head Blacksmith Ferris:

I need some *enchanted iron*. It's made by applying magic to iron ore. There aren't any Mystic around, so we'll have to improvise... A creature known as the *enchanted iron golem* can be found in the vicinity of the Ivory Tower. Peel off some of its scrap and bring it to me! I'll need about *five* pieces. These golems are quite durable, and won't peel away easily. Give it all you've got!
