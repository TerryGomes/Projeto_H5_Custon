!Head Blacksmith Ferris:

What brings you here? Ah, Leikar sent you? The Sewing kit she ordered, eh? I was just about to start on it. I'll just be a moment...

I must have some scraps of Steel somewhere around here...

Hmm... I must've used it all up!

Sorry, you'll have to come back later. I'm out of materials.

(Only a character of level 60 or above may undertake this quest.)
