!Chamberlain Alfred:

We have begun recruiting like-minded agents from the Varka Silenos in order to to reduce Asefa's power. Once these trustworthy followers gain the confidence of the Varka Silenos, have them approach the Varka's messenger, Naran Ashanuk. Then we will be able to obtain good information.
