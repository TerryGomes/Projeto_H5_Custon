!Chamberlain Alfred:

The Varka Silenos are in turmoil. Unless we act, we could be negatively affected. The solution, of course, is to also create turmoil among the Ketra Orcs. I suggest that you send trustworthy followers to the Varka Silenos to help stabilize them while we prepare to weaken the power of the Ketra Orcs. Have your agents approach the Varka messenger, Naran Ashanuk. Then leave the rest to them.

Remember that their credibility will be damaged if they also helped the Ketra Orcs.
