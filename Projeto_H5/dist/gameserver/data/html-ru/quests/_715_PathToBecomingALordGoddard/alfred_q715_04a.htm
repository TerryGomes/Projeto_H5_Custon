!Chamberlain Alfred:

We have begun recruiting like-minded agents from the Ketra Orcs in order to to reduce Wudan Mardui's power. Once these trustworthy followers gain the confidence of the Ketra Orcs, have them approach the Ketra's messenger, Wahkan. Then we will be able to obtain good information.
