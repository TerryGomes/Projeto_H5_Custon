!Guard Rath:

Destroy the lizardmen and take their bracelets as proof of your victory.

Kill the *Leto Lizardmen, Leto Lizardman Archers, Leto Lizardman Soldiers, Leto Lizardman Overlords', Leto Lizardman Warriors* and so on.  Don't attack their shaman! It might cause them to stop the ritual before our investigation is complete. The ritual must not end until our investigation is complete!

The guild had already sent me a reward for *60 bracelets*. I'll give it to you as soon as you earn it.
