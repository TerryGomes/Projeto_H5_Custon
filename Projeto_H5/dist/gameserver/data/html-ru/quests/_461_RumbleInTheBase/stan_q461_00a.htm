Thanks for your hard work. Today Pinaps doesn't have to worry anymore. Worrying just shaves time off your life, makes you wrinkly, and causes gas. A true friend will put up with all that to help take some of the stress away. True friends also bring salmon soup.

(You can take on this quest once per day, starting at 6:30 am.)
