!Nameless Spirit:

Oh, hello again! Yes, I spoke with Wigoth, and he assures me that this song is the one! *We can now pass through the force field.* It brings us one step closer to him, eh?

By the way, *could you help me put Frintezza to sleep*? As I said, we can't eliminate Frintezza completely with our power at its current level... But we can wait until he wakes up and then put him back to sleep before he can act!
