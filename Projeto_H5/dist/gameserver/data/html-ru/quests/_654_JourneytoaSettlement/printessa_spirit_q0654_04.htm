!Nameless Spirit:

Well... I need a *parchment to write the spell on*. Go to the *Wall of Argos* and slaughter the *Canyon Antelope* or the *Canyon Antelope Slave* and bring me the *Skin of the Antelope*! It'll make a lovely parchment!

Ah! By the way, *once you pass through the force field, only the Command Channel Leader in command of all the parties needs the scroll*. Therefore, only one skin is needed.
