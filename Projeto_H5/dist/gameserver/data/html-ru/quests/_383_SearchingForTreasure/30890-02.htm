Humph! I guess you're not as stupid as you look... Well, although it's only a part of it, it will lead you to the treasure of the great pirate Zaken... I know that you don't want to give up the map so easily.

Hey, listen! Wouldn't you like to know what kind of treasure is hidden out there? Just the sight of that map makes my heart pound like a drum!

How about this? I'll decipher and interpret the map for you, then you go and find the treasure. In exchange for my services, all i want is the treasure map. I'd like to keep it as a souvenir. What do you think?
