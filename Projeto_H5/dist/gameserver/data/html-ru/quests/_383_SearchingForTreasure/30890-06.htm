!Trader Espen:

Muska was a hardened pirate as well, who greatly distrusted people... and Fatima was no exception. The treasure map found on Muska's corpse was written in code, and no one could decipher it.

When Zaken's ship ran aground on Devil's Isle and its captain and all of his crew were killed, it seemed the map would never be decoded.

Fatima, enraged by this turn of events, demanded her new lover go to Devil's Isle immediately and find the treasure for her at any cost. Fatima's unfortunate lover was a mere tailor by trade and soon went missing, along with Muska's treasure map...

It was widely believed that the map was lost for good, and now you show up with it!
