!Trader Espen:

As a way of escaping my boring daily life, I have a hobby of collecting pirate memoribilia. I'm especially intrested in anything to do with Zaken, the legendary scourge of high seas.

It is said that he was once Zaken's boatswain, and when Zaken's ship was anchored at Innadril Harbor, he made off with a few treasure chests and stashed them somewhere on Alligator Island.

But, the exact location of the treasure chests hasn't been discovered yet...
