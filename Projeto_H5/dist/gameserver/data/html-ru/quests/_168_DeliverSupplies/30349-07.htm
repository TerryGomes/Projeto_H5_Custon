!Sentry Jeanine:

I see that you have not delivered the *swords* to my sisters yet. Please deliver the weapons to Sentries *Roselyn* and *Krispen* and bring back the *old bronze swords* they have been using.

*Roselyn* is standing guard at the entrance of the village. You can reach her by going through the cave behind me. And *Krispen* is on duty at the village entrance opposite *Roselyn*.
