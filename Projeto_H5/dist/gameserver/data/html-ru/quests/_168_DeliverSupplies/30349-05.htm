!Sentry Jeanine:

So *Master Harant* has not finished his task yet. We need to get that equipment soon ...

Well, we must first deliver these weapons to my sisters. Give me one sword, to begin with. And deliver the rest to *Sentry Roselyn* and *Sentry Krispen*. Bring back the *old bronze swords* they have been using while you're at it.

*Roselyn* is standing guard at the entrance of the village. You can reach her by going through the cave behind me. And *Krispen* is on duty at the village entrance opposite *Roselyn*.
