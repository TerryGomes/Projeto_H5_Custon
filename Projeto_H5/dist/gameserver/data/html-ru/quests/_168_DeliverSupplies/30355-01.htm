!Sentry Roselyn:

Is this the new sword? *Master Harant's* skills are the best, as always. This is an excellent weapon for the *Sentries*, who are responsible for the safety of the village, to use. Compared to this, the *old bronze sword* seems primitive. Here, take it. It is of no use to me anymore.
