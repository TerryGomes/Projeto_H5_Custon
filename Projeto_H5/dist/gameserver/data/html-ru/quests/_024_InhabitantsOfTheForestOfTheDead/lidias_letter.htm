!Lidia's Letter:

Thank you for finding our family's treasure! I only wish I could thank you in person! I was watshing you, even though I knew I shouldn't! By the way, do you have my hair pin? Ithink I lost it after some dealings with a magician, and I heard that you found it. If you have it, please send it to me.
