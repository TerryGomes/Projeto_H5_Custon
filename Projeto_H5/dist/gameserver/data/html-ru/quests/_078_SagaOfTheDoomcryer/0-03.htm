!Grand Seer Rahorakti:

Tarkai Zu Dudamara! A wandering Warcryer and a seer of webs! He rides on a web, and you can actually trace his path by looking at the webs he leaves behind!%%
He visited me a while back and told me to prepare for the eternal winter.%%
Unless I misunderstood him, you're the one he was talking about... You'll weave the coat that'll last all winter! Take this book that Tarkai left here, and proudly walk the path of a Warcryer!%%
Follow the trail first blazed by Tarkai! The Dudamara totem spirit will show you the way.
