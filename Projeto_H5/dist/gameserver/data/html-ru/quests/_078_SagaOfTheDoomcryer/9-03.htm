!Tablet of Vision:

A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A vision appears of a black knight!%%
And Mudaha, the former follower of Sharuhi! He channeled the very spirit of Sharuhi, and no other Warcryer could beat him!%%
After a while his name became synonomous with Sharuhi's. But now, only memories engraved in spidersilk are left to speak of those days.%%
Sharuhi trembles in loneliness. But he won't listen to other Warcryers!%%
Find him and make a Contract! Conjure the 100th spirit and channel it into the consciousness of Oroka. That is what you must do!%%
Tarkai's request makes sense now. Find the lizard totem Sharuhi! You must find the Tablet of Vision in the Forest of the Dead!
