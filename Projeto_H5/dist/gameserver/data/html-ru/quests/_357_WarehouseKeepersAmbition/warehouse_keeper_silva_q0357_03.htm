!Warehouse Freightman Silva:

... Keep your voice down! If old man Sorint overhears us, I could lose my job!

Where to start? Never mind all that stuff about the layaway service... I just wanted to get you alone! I need to hire an adventurer... Someone to be my partner in a business I'm starting...
