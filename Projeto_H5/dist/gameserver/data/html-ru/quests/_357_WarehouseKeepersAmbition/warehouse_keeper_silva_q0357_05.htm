Oops, oh yeah, him...

Ah! Mr. Sorint. It's nothing! Yes! Nothing unusual going on here, sir! Just helping this customer.

Damn that idiotic old fool... Anyway, this should be easy for you. Just bring me some *Jade Crystals*. They are all the rage this year among the noblewomen of Aden! The more of them you bring me, the greater your reward shall be. Bring me *100 or more at once* and I'll give you a bonus. Do we have a deal?

You'll find Jade Crystals in the *Enchanted Valley*. You may have some trouble with the *forest runners, the fline elders, the liele elders and the valley Treant elders*. Are you taking notes?

Ah, one more thing. Enchanted Valley is too dangerous a place to walk around by yourself. So, *bring me a few of your friends who can keep a secret. Not too many though... Once we have enough people, you can go there with them. It's too dangerous to go there alone.*
