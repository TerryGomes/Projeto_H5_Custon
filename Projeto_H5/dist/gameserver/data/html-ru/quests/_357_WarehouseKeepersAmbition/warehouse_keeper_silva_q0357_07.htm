!Warehouse Freightman Silva:

Wait here a moment, please... Mr. Sorint! Would you like a cup of tea? Do you need anything? Very well! Please come this way...

...That doddering old fool! I'm surprised he hasn't fallen off a cliff by now...

Have you brought me any Jade Crystals? Do you remember my offer? Bring me 100 or more of them and you get a bonus!
