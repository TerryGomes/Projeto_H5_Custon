Alright. If you go near the Purified Ceremony Hall, something called *Brazier of Purity* is raised everywhere.

This Magic Square is almost like a symbol for that Purified Ceremony Hall. In addition, that Magic Square disillusions Mucrokians who are interfering in our project, and thus makes them fiercely violent.

Please hurry and get rid of those awful Magic Squares. Bring me *10 Broken Pieve of Magic Force* as evidence.
