!Dr. Helvetica:

If i think about it, shouldn't this Brazier of Purity be a lifeless organism even if it may be the symbol of that Purified Ceremony Hall? I think one can destroy something like this to be a spy.

But if you're really a spy from the Purified Ceremony Hall, you won't be able to destroy the *Guardian Waterspirit* and *Evil Spirit of the Magic Field*, which are almost like their companions.
 Thus, I won't be able to doubt you anymore if you can destroy those and bring *20 fragments of the Guardian Spirit*.

Thus, please hurry and leave for the Purified Ceremony Hall!
