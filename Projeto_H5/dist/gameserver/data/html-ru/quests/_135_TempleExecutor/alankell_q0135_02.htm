!Captain Alex:

Ah, you must be the adventurer sent by the Temple. Welcome!

Our little Floran Village was built years ago by survivors of the Peasants' Rebellion. Because of that, the lord chooses not to use his troops to protect us. Our only hope against the encroaching monsters lies with adventurers like yourself.
