!Priest Shegfield:

Patience! I was just coming to that. It will not be difficult.

Help the people in Floran Village and they will provide you with letters of recommendation. The people who petitioned the Temple for help are Grocer Pano, Warehouse Keeper Sonin and Captain Alex.

*Ask Alex* for more information.
