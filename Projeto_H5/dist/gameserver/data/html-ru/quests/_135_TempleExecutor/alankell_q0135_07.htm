!Captain Alex:

Hunt the *Delu Lizardman Suppliers, Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers*. After you have collected all of the items, you should let Warehouse Keeper Sonin and Grocer Pano know that you have recovered their items. Then take the *10 Stolen Cargo items* to Sonin and take the *10 Hate Crystals* to Pano.

After you have received reference letters written by Sonin and Pano, bring the *10 Old Treasure Maps* to me.

Please do not delay!
