!Priest Shegfield:

If you achieve the *title of the Feet* and the *title of the Hands* of the Temple, you will be called *the Limbs* of the Temple.

To aspire to be the *Feet of the Temple*, ask *Priestess Glyvka*.

*High Priest Sylvain* can elevate you to the *position of the Hands of the Temple*.

Once you become the Limbs of the Temple, High Priest Sylvain will assign you new and more important duties.

Congratulations on your achievement! I trust you will serve Einhasad and her Temple well.
