!Captain Alex:

A number of goods -- about 10 items total -- have been stolen from Warehouse Keeper Sonin's warehouse.

During my investigation, I narrowed the list of suspects down to 5 creatures: *Delu Lizardman Suppliers, Special Agents, Commanders, Shaman and Cursed Seers*.

Find the thief, recover the *10 Stolen Cargo* items and return them to Sonin.

Then I am sure he will, in gratitude, provide you with the letter of reference.
