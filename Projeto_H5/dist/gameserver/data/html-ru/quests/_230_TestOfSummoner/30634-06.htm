!High Summoner Galatea:

The card is engraved with the Summoner's name and unique mark. The tradition of the Arcana Card derives from the need for Summoner's to exult in their victories.

As an apprentice Summoner may not begin battle until a higher level Summoner has given you a card. *If you do not have an apprentice Arcana Card, the opponent will not accept your challenge.* You must give your opponent an Arcana Card each time you lose battle, so it is suggested that you make 3 or 4 extra cards.

If you win, you are given your opponent's Arcana Card. It is easy to see who a Summoner has defeated by looking at his or her Arcana Cards.
