!Summoner Brynthea:

Ah, didn't you leave yet? I think you will become a good master and ruler. You were traveling to get the Mark of the Summoner, right? I hope I can fight you as a real Summoner in the near future... Blood and screams, violence and pain... Just the thought of it already makes me excited, ha ha.
