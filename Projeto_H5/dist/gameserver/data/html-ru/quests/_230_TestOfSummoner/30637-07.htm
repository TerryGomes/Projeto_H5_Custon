!Summoner Belthus:

Oh my! The control!

Hmm, I lost. Just when I thought I had won, I let a crack in my concentration... I must look like a fool to lose after all that bragging! Here, take *my Arcana Card. Take good care of it.*

Anyway, it was a good experience. Our defeat, was an eye-opener for me as well as for Turen. Goodbye my friend. I will be looking forward to our next battle.
