!High Summoner Galatea:

I have several ideas for potential opponents for you.

First of all, you should try *Summoner Almors*.  His has been sick lately and is recovering on *Talking Island*. 

You should try *Summoner Basillia*.  I have heard that she is busy researching a new form of Summoning magic nearby a farm on *the southern shores of Gludio*.

*Summoner Carmoniell* of the Elves has been in seclusion in a *cottage in southern Dion*. I've heard he has had some trouble lately. 

*Summoner Celestiel* usually resides in the Ivory Tower, but has returned to *the Elven Woods* on urgent business from the homeland.

The Dark Elves *Summoner Brynthea* and *Summoner Belthus* are proper opponents for you, but they are hard to find, as they are not likely to stay in one place. Last I heard, Brynthea was somewhere in the *northeastern parts of Giran*, and Belthus was somewhere in the *Cruma marshlands*...

These Summoners are all proud and haughty people, and may scoff at a challenge from an apprentice Summoner like yourself, but they will likely accept the challenge, even if it is merely to display their supremacy.
