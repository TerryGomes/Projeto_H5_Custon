!High Summoner Galatea:

In the thousands of years since the world was young, when Elves and the the elementals of the woods made their agreement and declared their allegiance, summoning magic has evolved into a high level art. Along with elemental spells that command fire and wind, summoning magic is one of the 3 traditional magical arts of the Ivory Tower.

Summoning magic is not an easy path. High level magic is required to communicate with creatures of the netherworld, enter into a contract with them, and bring them to your side. A very strong will is required to make the summoned creature obey your command.

Many magicians have lost their lives for lack of a strong will when summoning. Therefore, high level summoning spells must only be taught to those whose skills have been acknowledged. You seem to be on a path that is not related to Summoning magic. This is not a study to be taken lightly.
