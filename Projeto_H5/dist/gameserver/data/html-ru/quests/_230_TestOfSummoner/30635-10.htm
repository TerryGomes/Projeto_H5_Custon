!Summoner Almors:

Didn't you already beat me in the 'Summoner's Battle' and win my Arcana Card? Did you come to make fun of me? I won't even be able to hold up my head when I return to the Ivory Tower of Oren... All the others will laugh at me if they find out that I had been beaten by a apprentice Summoner...
