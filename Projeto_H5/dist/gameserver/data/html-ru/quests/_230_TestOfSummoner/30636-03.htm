!Summoner Carmoniell:

Whew... You never give up, do you? I bet you will still insist on fighting with me though it is the end of the world tomorrow? OK, I shall accept your challenge to a duel. Instead, I shall not play it easy. It will be over in 1 minute. I will introduce you to my friend, unicorn racer.

Then. You start first. I suppose you are aware of the rules including the one that the battle is only between the animals. Let's get started.
