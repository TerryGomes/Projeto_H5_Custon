!High Summoner Galatea:

This trial tests for the talents to become a Summoner. The method is very simple. You must *seek out and battle many other Summoners*. *Achieve victory against 6 opponents* and you will be able to pass the trial.

This may seem an easy task, but *a battle between Summoners* is the most difficult and most effective method of testing the ability of a Summoner to control his or her summoned creature.
