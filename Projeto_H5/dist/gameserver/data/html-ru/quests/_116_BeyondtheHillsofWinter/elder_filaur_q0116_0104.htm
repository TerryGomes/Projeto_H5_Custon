!Filaur of the Grat Pillar Guild:

This if fortuitous timing! Come closer, so that my aging eyes can see you better... ah, yes, I can see that you are an experienced adventurer. I have a task that requires the skills of someone just like you.

Before you embark on it, however, you'll need some things. Let me think... yes, I believe that *20 Bandages*, *5 energy Stones* and *10 Skeleton Keys* should be it. Bring them to me as quickli as you can!
