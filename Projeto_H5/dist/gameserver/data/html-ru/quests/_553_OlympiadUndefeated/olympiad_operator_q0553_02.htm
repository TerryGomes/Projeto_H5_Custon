Grand Olympiad Manager:

Enter the Olympiad and take on the challenge of *10 consecutive wins*! As you know, consecutive wins means not losing along the way. Whether you have *2 consecutive wins* or *5 consecutive wins*, you will receive a reward. But it will be nothing compared to the reward for 10 consecutive wins. Also, *5 and 10 consecutive wins* will get you the *Medal of Honor*. If you're ready, you can come to me. But please remember that once you receive the reward, you cannot take on this mission again today.
