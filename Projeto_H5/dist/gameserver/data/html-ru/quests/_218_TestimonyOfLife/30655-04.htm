!Isael Silvershadow:

You have found all of the pieces of *Talin's spear*! Reassembling this will be easy for me! I studied the art of weaponry with *Hierarch Terestian* of the lake fairies.

Now! Take this spear and return to *Thalia*. Please find the *Water of Life* so that the *Mother Tree* may become green and healthy once more. May Sayha of the Winds guide you safely home...
