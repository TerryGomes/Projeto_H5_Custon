I didn't think you would actually find it...  Even though this is a copy it is certainly *Andariel's Book*. I see that your situation is urgent.  

Giving life to that which is destined to die is against nature and contrary to the will of Shilen. Wouldn't it be more appropriate to let die what should die?

Oh well, it is obvious nothing will change your mind.  I am through talking about it. Here is some *Stardust* as promised... Take it and go!
