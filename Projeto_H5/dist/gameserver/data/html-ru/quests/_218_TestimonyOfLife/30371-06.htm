!Thalia:

The *Pure Mithril Cup*... It is indeed a masterpiece. Sometimes the Dwarves are worth themselves. To perform the ceremony of turning a Mithril Cup into a *Grail of Purity*, we need *Stardust*. It is the silvery powder which is said to be sprinkled by the spirits of starlight at night. The skills to gather it is handed down only among those who have now turned into Dark Elves.

Unfortunately we need the Dark Elves to obtain the Stardust. Dark Elves, our dark shadow... Although they are unforgivable creatures, in order for us to survive, and also for the survival of all the forests in this land... We need their help absolutely.

Go to the *Dark Elves Initiation Altar* and meet a *Shaman called Arkenia*. She knows how to make the *Stardust*. I shall write you a letter. But I wonder if the hostile Dark Elves will give us help without any problems...
