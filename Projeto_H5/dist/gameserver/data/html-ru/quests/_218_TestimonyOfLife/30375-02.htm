!Priest Adonius:

Thank you very much, brother of forest. Then I shall tell you what you can help us with. Right now, we are short of ink and pens which are used for making the copies.

To make the ink, we need the *Spider Ichor*. You can extract them from the *spiders of Cruma Marshlands* . And for the pens we need the *Harpy's Down*. I would be grateful if you could bring *20 of them, each* . If you bring me all of these, I shall give you a copy of the book in return.
