Oh, so price is no object is it? Hmm...

...Then how about this? I cannot tell you the recipe, but if you bring me *Andariel's Book* that you Elves of Light think so precious, I will give you some *Stardust*.

The Book was actually a part of 'Kaisha's Revelation' which contained Shilen's secret, but the followers of Einhasad edited it for their own purposes.

This book made by the hypocrites of the Light is certainly corrupted, but perhaps I could find some clues about Kaisha's Revelation. 

As far as I know, *Andariel's Book* is in the *Temple of Einhasad in Gludin* .  I care not how you get it, just bring it to me.  Produce the book and I will give you some *Stardust* . 

I swear by the Gaze of Abyss that this promise will be kept.
