!Blacksmith Pushkin:

What a pity, I thought Elves all had good memories. I will tell you once more. First get *10 units of pure Mithril ore*. You can find it by hunting the *Guardian Basilisks* in the *Corridor of Death*, north of *Giran*.

Next,*20 bottles of ant soldier's liquid*. You can find these ants in the caves of the *Wastelands of Gludio*.

Also *20 wyrm claws*. Wyrms are often seen in *Giran*.
