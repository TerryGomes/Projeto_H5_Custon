!Thalia:

May the blessings of the starlight be with you. You have recovered *Talin's Spear*! Thank you so much for your trouble.

Now that we both have the *Grail of Purity* and the *Talin's Spear* we can set off in search for the *Water of Life*. But it is impossible without the biggest sacrifice and the greatest sorrow... 

We must pierce the *Unicorn of Eva* which can be called the guardian of our forest with the *Talin's Spear* and collect its *tears* in the *Grail of Purity*. That is the *Water of Life* itself. After all, in order to recover the life of the *Mother Tree*, we must deprive the life of our dearest Eva's incarnation, the unicorn...

Now do you see what you have to do? May the Goddess forgive us for our deed...
