!Master Cardien:

Soon we will have to face a great difficulty which our future depends on. The *Mother Tree*... is dying... We must, even at the cost of any sacrifice, protect the *Mother Tree*.

To overcome this hardship, *Hierarch Asterios* is calling for the young Elves to gather in the *Elven Forest*. You must also return to your homeland. But not yet. You are still... Unprepared. You still need to have more experience.
