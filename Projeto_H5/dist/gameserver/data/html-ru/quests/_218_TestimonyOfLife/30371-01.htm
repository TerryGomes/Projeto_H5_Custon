!Thalia:

How is the Hierarch? He must be constantly worried sick about the future of our race...we should do all we can to lighten his burden.

My sisters and I have been exploring many methods to revive the dying *Mother Tree*, but all our efforts have failed. But still there is hope.

According to the legends passed down from the Guardian of the Mother Tree, there is a *Water of Life* that can cure all diseases and poisons. It is said that the purest powers of life, used by the Gods to create all the living creatures on this land, is contained in that water.

Eva has entrusted this *Water of Life* to the 'Guard of Tears.' I cannot tell you yet who he is, but to obtain the *Water of Life* from that person is the *Test of Life* that you must take. It is something that we must do in order to survive, but it is sad that we cannot avoid making huge sacrifices for it...
