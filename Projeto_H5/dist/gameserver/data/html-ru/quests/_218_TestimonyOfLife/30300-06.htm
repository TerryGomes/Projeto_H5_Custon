!Blacksmith Pushkin:

First I will need  a very pure, specially-made varnish to refine *pure Mithril*. Using normal varnish to refine *pure Mithril* will destroy it. This special varnish is derived from the secretions of giant ants.

You will find these ants in the *Wastelands of Gludio*. There are hundreds of giant ants in the underground there... Kill only *ant soldiers* and collect the *liquid from their body* in a bottle. 20 bottles will be enough.

And last, we will need *wyrm claws*. Carving a Mithril surface requires a strong and sharp knife, normal knives and chisels are not suitable. I need a chisel made from  *wyrm claws*. Please get me 20 unbroken claws.

So, the 3 materials we need are: *Pure Mithril ore*, *ant soldier liquid* and *wyrm claws*. You can remember all this, right? Good luck, Elf!
