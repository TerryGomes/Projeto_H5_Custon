!Thalia:

I have some sad news. *The Talin's Sword has been stolen on its way here!* It is said that the lake spirits who were transporting the the spear from *Innadril* were attacked by the lizardmen who massacred them and took away the spear.

Hurry! Go and meet *Isael Silvershadow of the Hunter's Village*. Help him in dealing with this matter. We must find the *Talin's Sword*! Our future lies in it!
