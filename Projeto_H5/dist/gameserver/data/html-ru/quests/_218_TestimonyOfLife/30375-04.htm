!Priest Adonius:

Thank you for your help, brother of forest. Take this. It is the *copy of Andariel's Book* . You didn't say so, but I already knew. That this bible is needed to save the *Mother Tree*, which is in danger of falling into the hands of our enemies...

But I have faith in that the Goddess of harmony and life will lead you to the right way. Never forget to listen to the blowing winds, the trickling of waters and the whispers from the starlight. The Goddess will always be with us.
