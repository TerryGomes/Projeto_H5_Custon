!Blacksmith Pushkin:

Finished at last! It was well worth the wait, wasn't it? Not to brag, but this would fetch hundreds of adena if you were to sell it in a store.

I will put it in this sturdy box for you, handle it with care! Even though our time together was short, it was enjoyable!  I can work with an Elf like you.  May the fertility of Maphr be with you and your family!
