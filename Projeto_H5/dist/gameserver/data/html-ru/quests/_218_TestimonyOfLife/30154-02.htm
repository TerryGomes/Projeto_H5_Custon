!Hierarch Asterios:

Ignorance and greed is not exclusive to Humans. We also should watch out for such faults...

The reason I called for young *Elves* such as you, is because the mother of all *Elves*, our *Mother Tree*, is dying. We should prevent this from happening, at all costs. This is a big trial for all Elves. Are you ready to devote yourself to protecting our *Mother Tree*?
