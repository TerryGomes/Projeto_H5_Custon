!Blacksmith Pushkin:

The price?  Do you think Dwarves will do anything for money?   How dare you...! You think we don't have any pride? Hey Elf! Have you heard of Dwarf Artisans? 

OK, if you will apologize for your impertinence, and also apologize on behalf of your whole race which has treated dwarves with such contempt, then I will think about it.
