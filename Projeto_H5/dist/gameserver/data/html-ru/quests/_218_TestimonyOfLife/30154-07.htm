!Hierarch Asterios:

I am so sorry to put such a burden on a young Elf like you. But it is your fate that you must carry on with.

Please, Find the Water of Life and give life to the *Mother Tree* once more. The process of finding the water will itself be a painful task that requires patience and sacrifice. I will give you this amulet which contains the blessing of the Mother Tree guardians, so keep it safe with you.

*Thalia* and her sisters know more than anyone else about the Water of Life. Ask for their help. Take this letter that I give you and meet her. You can find her in the *eastern part of the Iris Lake*.
