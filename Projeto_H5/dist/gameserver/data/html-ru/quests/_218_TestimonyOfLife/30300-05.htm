!Blacksmith Pushkin:

You can get *pure Mithril* from *Guardian Basilisks*. Basilisks eat sand and pebbles to help their digestion. 

You will find small amounts of *pure Mithril ore* when you cut open their gut. You will find the *Guardian Baselisks* at the corner that connects the towns of *Giran* and *Oren*. This place is known as the *Death Pass* because of the abundance of monsters there.

There are more materials needed than *pure Mithril*...
