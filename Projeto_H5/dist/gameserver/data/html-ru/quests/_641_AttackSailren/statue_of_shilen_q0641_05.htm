!Shilen's Stone Statue:

Very well. Yes, you are truly the one sent by mother Shilen... Listen carefully as I tell you about dinosaurs that may contain Gazkh fragments.

You will encounter predatory dinosaurs such as *Velociraptor and Pterosaur*. They are not as strong as Sailren, but vicious nevertheless. These are the most likely to contain the fragments. Go and hunt them -- find the fragments! Remember, you must return with at least *30* fragments. If you bring me 30 fragments or more, I will reforge them into an intact axe head. Ah, could our deliverance finally be at hand?

May Shilen help you strike true!
