!Ghost of Adventurer:

Please, do this for me! Hunt the *monsters in the Imperial Tomb*. Bring me *1000* relics and I'll give you some scraps of paper I've collected. Many people really like my scraps of paper. I'm not sure, but I think they're some sort of weapon recipes...

While you're doing this, you may find a *sepulcher pass* that was carried by one of the aristocrats. Ask the nameless ghost near the Four Sepulchers, he will tell you what it's for.
