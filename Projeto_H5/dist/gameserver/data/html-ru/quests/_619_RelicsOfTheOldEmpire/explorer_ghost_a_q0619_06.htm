!Ghost of Adventurer:

You don't have 1000 relics yet? Hunt the *monsters in the Imperial Tomb*, you should be able to obtain them. Keep trying! Collect *1000* relics and bring them to me, I'll give you a very nice piece of paper, supposedly a recipe for some sort of weapon.

Ah, I see that you have the *sepulcher pass*! Ask the *nameless ghost near the Four Sepulchers*, he'll tell you what it's for.
