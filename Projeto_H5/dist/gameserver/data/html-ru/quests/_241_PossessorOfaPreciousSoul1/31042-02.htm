!Melody Maestro Kantabilon:

The Echo Crystal is a fragile object and is easily broken. This one is worn out after so many years, and needs to be restored. It's delicate work requiring specialized tools. I'll need the long and sturdy claws of Malruk succubi from the Dragon Valley.

Bring me ten sharp claws. Make sure they are in excellent condition!
