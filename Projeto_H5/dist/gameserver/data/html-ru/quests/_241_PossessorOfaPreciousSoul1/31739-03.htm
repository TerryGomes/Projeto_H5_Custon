!Talien:

Come in! Is this the record? Great job! The record of the seventeen heroes who confronted the Land Dragon!

This is truly fascinating! Now I can write all about the story! What remarkable people! If only they could've survived their heroic encounter with Antharas! What dreams they must have had!

That brings me to my point... I still need to gather much more information. Will you help me a little bit more?
