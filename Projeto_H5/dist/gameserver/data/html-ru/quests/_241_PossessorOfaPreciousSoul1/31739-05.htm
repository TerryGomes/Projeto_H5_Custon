!Talien:

Welcome back!  I've been reading the records you gave me and I found something very interesting!

The stories all have something in common. They all met the Lady of the Lake and came across the Star of Destiny.

Is this the Echo Crystal that contains the Forgotten Song? Great job! We can only listen to it once. We can create a musical score if we take this to my friend, Barbado.

Will you continue to help me?
