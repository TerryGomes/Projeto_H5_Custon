My granddaughter Kassandra suffers from a grave illness. She was always weak, but her nightmares are robbing her of what little strength she has left.

She was born with a special gift to foresee the future in her dreams. Ogmar thinks you might be able to help, so I asked you to come. He knows all the details, talk to him.
