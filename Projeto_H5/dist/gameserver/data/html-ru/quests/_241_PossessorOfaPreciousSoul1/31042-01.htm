!Melody Maestro Kantabilon:

I can't believe somebody still knows about the song! Yes, I have a crystal like that. It's my most cherished possession, but I will gladly give it to someone who appreciates it's value!

There is one problem that must be solved first, otherwise taking the crystal won't help you.
