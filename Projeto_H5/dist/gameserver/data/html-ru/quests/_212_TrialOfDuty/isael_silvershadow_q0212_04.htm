Well done! The guards' families will be eternally grateful for your services. The representative of the families has asked me to present you with this jewel. It is called *the Tear of Loyalty*.

Grandmaster Hannavalt has requested that you go to *Father Dustin* in *Giran Castle Town*. He shall give you your final task.
