!Priest Dustin:

Welcome, noble Knight. May the blessings of Einhasad be with you.

I am troubled by recent violence of the foreign races. We have lost many of our young in fights with them... Just six months ago, a fine, strapping young lad named *Leon Athebaldt* was killed in battle with the Breka Orcs.
