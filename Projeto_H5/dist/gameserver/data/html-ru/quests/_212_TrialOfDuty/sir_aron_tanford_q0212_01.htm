!Sir Aaron Tanford:

*Dignity* is one of the virtues that define a Knight's worth. Dignity takes various forms in different people...

As we speak there are vicious gangs, who know nothing of dignity, prowling the Wastelands disturbing the residents. These gangs are led by *Herod*. He was once a prestigious Knight of Gludio.

During the war against Gracia, Herod was tempted to treason by the enemy's leader. He became an agent of the invaders! Sir Klaus Vasper chased him doggedly and eventually put a spear through his heart. Karol said that 'A Knight who abandons his dignity is as good as dead.' Not wanting to give the traitor the dignity of a funeral, his corpse was left to rot in the Wastelands.

This made his soul become a cursed devil, and the only way to get rid of him is to free him from the curse with this rusty sword. *The skeleton raiders wandering around the Wastelands* are his minions. As you destroy the filthy skeleton raiders one by one, you will confront the *Spirit of Herod*. Kill him with the rusty sword I gave you, and remind him of the noble dignity of a Gludio Knight. If possible, please bring proof of his end.
