!Sir Kiel Nighthawk:

Greetings, young Warrior. I am Kiel Nighthawk of the Griffon Knight union. Hannavalt sent word that you were coming.

One of the virtues that define a Knight's character is a *sense of justice*. The history of this land of Dion is rife with gross injustice. One of the most heinous was the case of Sir Talianus.

He was commissioned by the King to write a report about the causes and effects of the peasant's uprising. He was captured by rebels and accused of being a spy. He suffered days of unspeakable torture before death mercifully came. His report was torn up and scattered to the wind.

His troops tried to collect the pieces of the report and they suffered the same fate as their leader.

Until this day people claim that they hear the agonized wails of Sir Talianus and his troops, wafting across the execution grounds. I fear that their spirits are wandering the earth, unable to join with Shilen... Would you please seek justice for Sir Talianus?

Kill the *strains* and the *ghouls* to collect the *torn pieces of the report*. When you gather all the pieces and complete *Talianus' Report* bring it back to me.
