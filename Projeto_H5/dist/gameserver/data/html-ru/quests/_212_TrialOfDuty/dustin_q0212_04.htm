!Priest Dustin:

*The Orcs have an appalling custom of carrying around the remains of their enemies as a sort of charm or amulet.* They say that the more courageous the enemy, the greater the power... It is said that Athebaldt's remains were cut up into pieces and and fashioned into amulets for the *Breka Orc Overlords*. These creatures are fierce and violent! But I must give Leon a proper burial. Can you retrieve his remains for me?
