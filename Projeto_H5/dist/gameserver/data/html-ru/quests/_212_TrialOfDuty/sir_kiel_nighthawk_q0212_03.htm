!Sir Kiel Nighthawk:

Ah, the report that was to be presented to the King... Perhaps now we can release the spirits of Sir Talianus and his comrades from their torment...

Take this *Mirror of Orpic* with you and go to the Execution Grounds. There is power dwelling in this mirror which enables you to see the spirits of the dead. You must find and confront the doomed *hangman tree*. Free the spirits of Sir Talianus and his troops from their prison. Tell the spirit of Sir Talianus that the report for which he and his men gave their lives will be delivered to the King. This should give them peace at last.
