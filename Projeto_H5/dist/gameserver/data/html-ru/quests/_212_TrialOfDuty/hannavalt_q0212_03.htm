!Grand Master Hannavalt:

Do you hold higher ambitions than being a mere Knight? You must examine your motivation for fighting. It may be to protect loved ones, for the glory of the kingdom, for power... But true knights fight for the *'calling'* that is given them. The Trial of Duty is the way for you to determine what your calling is.
