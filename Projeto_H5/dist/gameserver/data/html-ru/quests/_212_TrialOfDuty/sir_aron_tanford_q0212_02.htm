!Sir Aaron Tanford:

I realize that it is not an easy task. But it is necessary for you to do it in order to acquire brilliance. You must kill the *Spirit of Herod* with the rusty sword I gave you, and free him from his disgraceful curse. While killing the *skeleton raiders wandering around the Wastelands* you will confront Herod.
