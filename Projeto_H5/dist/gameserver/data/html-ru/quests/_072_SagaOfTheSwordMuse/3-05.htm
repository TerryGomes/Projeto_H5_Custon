!Beast Herder Tunatun:

You've brought the Divine Stone of Wisdom, right?%%
All right. Now, I'll give you the Stone of Commune.%%
Actually, I'm hoping to get two stones of sacred wisdom! One from the Varka Silenos and one from the Ketra Orcs... If I had two stones, I could meet with the chiefs of both tribes!%%
If I could just get them talking, I think we could establish a peace that would let us share our common land to our mutual benefit!%%
Ah, yes! You wanted the Stone of Commune, right?
