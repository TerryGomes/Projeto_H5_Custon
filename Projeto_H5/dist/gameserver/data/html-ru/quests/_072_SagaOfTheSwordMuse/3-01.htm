!Beast Herder Tunatun:

What? The Stone of Commune?%%
Uh... As a matter of fact, yes, I have it! But I can't give it to you!%%
Let me explain... For as long as I can remember, I've had but one dream! It was the same every night, but forgotten soon after waking. But recently, I remembered it!%%
I dream of being able to communicate with all other intelligent beings! I suppose I'm getting ahead of myself... Basically, I just want everyone to understand each other... And the animals! I've always loved animals and want people to be able to talk with them!%%
I believe that this Stone of Commune will lead me there... But, if you really need it, I'll give it to you. Just trade me something of equal value for it.
