!Priest Cerenas:

The Stone of Commune, eh? I'll bet you're looking for the tablet too, aren't you?%%
Ah yes, the song of the Swordsinger... Surely you've heard the story of the legendary singer who followed the same path!? What was his name? Biel or something...?%%
What? You fought him?%%
So the stories were true! The merciful heart of Eva must have called you to help the one who has lost his way...%%
Legend says that the goddess herself watches over Elves on that pilgrimage! That's you!%%
If my memory serves, you'll find the location of the next stone from the tablet.%%
Unfortunately, this one is mine and you can't have it!
