My only function is to guide pilgrims on their way.%%
You've already been on this path for a while, and seen several tablets. You are truly a pilgrim.%%
This stone will prove your victory over the Archon of Halisha and his minions. Find them in the Four Sepulchers or in the Shrine of the Loyal near the Wall of Argos. If you fight the enemies and collect the marks of Halisha 700 or more, you can see the Archon of Halisha. You must slaughter the* Archon of Halisha*!
