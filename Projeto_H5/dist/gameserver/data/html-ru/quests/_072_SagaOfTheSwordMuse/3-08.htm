!Beast Herder Tunatun:

Although it's certainly not my problem, I suppose I should let you in on where the Stone of Commune will take you! The Stone of Commune is linked with the stone tablet on the north of the Varka Silenos Barracks.%%
You must find that stone tablet! Meanwhile, I'll study the Divine Stone of Wisdom and try to find what I'm looking for, so that someday all species will be able to communicate with each other!
