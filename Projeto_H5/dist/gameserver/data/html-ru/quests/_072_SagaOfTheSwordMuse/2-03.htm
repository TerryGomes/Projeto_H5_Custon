!Blacksmith Feynn:

Huh?%%
Is that a beer?! Amazing! You really brought it! I thought you were just a weakling entertainer!%%
I'm impressed! I guess if I live long enough, I'll see everything! You even brought snacks! You really take care of your customers, don't you?%%
You passed the beer test with flying colors, but now comes the hard part!%%
I haven't heard you sing yet! Sing me a song and then I'll decide whether or not to tell you how to get the stone of pilgrimage!
