Oh yeah, great song, buddy!%%
You passed the test! You know, a while back, a lady wearing a blue dress appeared to me in a dream!%%
She said that soon I'd be visited by a singer seeking a test. She told me I should do it.%%
Do you know the test? It was respect! To pass the test, the person would do as I asked, no matter how rude my manner was. And, he would sing a song with a sincere heart...%%
Here is the Stone of Commune. Take it with you to the Tablet of Vision. The first tablet can be found in the south part of the Tower of Insolence.%%
I'll pray that your song becomes popular! Oh, and thanks for the beer! Ha! Good luck!
