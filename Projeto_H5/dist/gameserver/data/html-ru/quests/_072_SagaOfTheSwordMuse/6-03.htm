!Tablet of Vision:

Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.%%
You see a vision of a male Elf, singing to thunderous applause!%%
You once read about him in a book called* "Critique of Biel's Song"*.%%
Could he have the next Stone of Commune?%%
He's waiting at the next Tablet of Vision, in the northeast corner of the Ketra Orc Outpost!
