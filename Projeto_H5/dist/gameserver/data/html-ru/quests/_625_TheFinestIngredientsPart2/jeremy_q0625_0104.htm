!Chef Jeremy:

All right, now find the Icicle Emperor Bumbalump, or whatever you want to call him, and put out this food and wait.

He loves to eat, and won't be able to resist such a scrumptious meal from a world-class chef!

You must hurry! Kill that filthy creature and bring me his meat!

One more thing... He's quite a messy eater, and sometimes the table gets broken. If that happens, wait until he fixes the table.
