!Hermit:

Well, go to the Ketra Orcs and get the Divine Stone of Wisdom. Like I said, Ketra Orcs are not the ones who trust strangers easily. To obtain Ketra Orcs' trust, you should go to* Ketra's Messenger Wahkan in the Ketra Orc Outpost*, and carry out difficult tasks that he asks you to do. You must earn the trust of the Ketra Orcs! This won't be an easy task, and will take much time and patience. Remember to never help their mortal enemies, the Varka Silenos! You'd never regain their trust!
