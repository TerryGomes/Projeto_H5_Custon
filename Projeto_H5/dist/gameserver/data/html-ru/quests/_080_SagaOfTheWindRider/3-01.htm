!Hermit:

I've been expecting you.%%
You follow in the footsteps of giants!%%
I've been waiting for many, many years... Since the gods told me to expect a hero such as you! I have the stone of vision you seek.%%
First, however, you must prove that you are who you appear to be... Will you take a test?
