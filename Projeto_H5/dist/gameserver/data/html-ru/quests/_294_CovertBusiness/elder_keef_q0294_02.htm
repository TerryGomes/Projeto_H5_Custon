!Elder Keef:

As you know, the * Bronze Key Guild* travels the continent collecting rare materials. We received a request, and I'm looking for a person with the right qualifications to manage the assignment.

I'm in urgent need of a person, but I can't give this job to just anybody in off the street ... It's hard to find reliable help these days.

But it seems like I can trust you. I am a good judge of character. I can tell what a person is like at a single glance. Let me see your eyes ... You do your work in silence no matter what others may think about it ... You seem to be that kind of person ... What do you think? Am I right? I want to give you a task. How does that sound? You want to give it a try?
