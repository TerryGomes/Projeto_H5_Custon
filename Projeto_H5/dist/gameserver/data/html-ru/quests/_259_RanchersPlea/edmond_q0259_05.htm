!Edmond:

Thank you for your trouble. I hope you didn't get hurt? As we promised, I will reward you for each giant spider husk that you have brought. Here, take this.

Thanks to your help, I will soon be able to graze my cattle without any worries. Just thinking of that makes me so happy. I can picture my sheep peacefully grazing in the pastures on the green hillside.
