!Marius:

May the blessings of the starlight fall upon you. So you are the mercenary hired by my colleague Edmond. I was once a Knight with a sword... But... something happened and I pledged not to touch a sword again. I am retired now.

I felt terrible that I haven't been able to help Edmond. Thankfully, I owe you gratitude for volunteering to kill these spiders for us.

Tell me if you need anything. *I will exchange two healing potions, fifty arrows, 60 soulshots or 30 spiritshots for ten giant spider husks.*
