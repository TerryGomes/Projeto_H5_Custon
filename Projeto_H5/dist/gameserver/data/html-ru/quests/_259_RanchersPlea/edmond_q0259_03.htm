!Edmond:

Hunt the *giant spiders* that are wrecking havoc in this area, then bring their husks back to me. I will reward you for each giant spider husk you bring back.

Oh, and if you need something while hunting those spiders, ask my friend, *Marius*. He takes care of everything that we bring from the village.
