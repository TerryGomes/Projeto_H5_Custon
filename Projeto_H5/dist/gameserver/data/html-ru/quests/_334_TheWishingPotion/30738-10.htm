Then carefully add wish scent... OK! It's done. Oh, but talk to me before using the wish potion. That's because there are some things to prepare before getting your wish.

And take this. It's my proof, but if you bring it I'll make you wish potion again. Of course, you'll have to gather together the ingredients then too. Alright, so this is gratitude enough, don't you think?
