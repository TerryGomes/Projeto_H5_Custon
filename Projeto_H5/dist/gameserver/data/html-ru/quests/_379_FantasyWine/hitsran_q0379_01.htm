!Guard Harlan:

Hello, stranger! My wife just recently gave birth to a beautiful baby girl!

The countless amusements of fatherhood fill me with indescribable joy... I just want to play peek-a-boo all day! I don't care if people laugh... I would do anything for my precious baby!

I need a favor, but you are not yet skilled enough to do it for me. Please come back to see me later.
