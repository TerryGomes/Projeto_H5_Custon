!Guard Harlan:

Oh, great! Please bring me 80 *leaves of eucalyptus*... That should be enough for one barrel of wine.

I'll need some *stones of chill* to properly age the wine... 100 should be enough.

If you bring me these items, I'll give you a genuine bottle of Dion wine! No cost is too high for the sake of my precious daughter!
