!Piotur:

When we were at war with Gracia, all the farmers of this region sought refuge in the east at Castle Gludio. However, when we returned to this land after the war, the turek orcs were occupying the surrounding area!

The lord is at the height of pursuing reconstruction, but his attention does not extend to remote farm villages like this one. However, we cannot wait forever for the lord's help, can we? My brother and I have decided to collect money and hire mercenaries. We will recover the blessed land that we inherited from our ancestors!

Now that I come to mention it, you look like quite an experienced mercenary yourself. What do you think? Will you lend us your strength to recover the farmland that the orcs took away from us? I will give you ample compensation.
