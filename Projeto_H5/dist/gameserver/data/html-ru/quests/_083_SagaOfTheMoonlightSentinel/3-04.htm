!Pilgrim of Darkness:

I didn't say that it was going to be easy. Like I said, Ketra Orcs and Varka Silenos do not easily trust strangers. To gain their trust, you must go to* Ketra's Messenger Wahkan of the Ketra Orcs*, and* Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk of the Varka Silenos*, and carry out the duty that they ask you to do. You seemed desperate to catch the person at any cost. Could I have misjudged you?
