Messenger:

Measuring your abilities is actually very simple.

Just raise some beasts and bring me the proof.

Raise them well, so they have a good heart, and they'll produce a *Crystal of Purity*. Bring me *10 Crystals of Purity* and your ability will be proven.

Remember to raise them along with your Clan, making sure to watch them closely.
