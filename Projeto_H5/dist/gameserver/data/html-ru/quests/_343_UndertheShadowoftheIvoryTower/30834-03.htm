!Magic Trader Cema:

Will you join our research? We are investigation the use of Nebulite for the 
greater public good. However, we are having a hard time finding Nebilte for our 
study. The Dwarwen collectors we hired for this task have not been heard from 
in over a month.

Would you do this work for us? Arround the crater of Ivory Tower you will find 
*Manashen gargoyles*, *enchanted monster eyes*, *enchanted stone golems*, and 
*enchanted iron golems*. They have fallen under the spell of *Nebulite Orbs*, 
which are fragments of the meteorite. If you kill these monsters you can easily 
collect the Nebulite samples we need for our research.

You shall be well-compensated for you efforts.
