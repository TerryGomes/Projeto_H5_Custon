!Tablet of Vision:

Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. The cascade of brief images is unintelligible at first...%%
As the pain subsides, a vision of the next tablet emerges, and it seems to be* north of the border outpost*. There must be a Stone of Commune nearby! It looks like the legendary Naverius has it! And then the vision fades. You must immediately go* north of the border outpost* and find the Stone of Commune.
