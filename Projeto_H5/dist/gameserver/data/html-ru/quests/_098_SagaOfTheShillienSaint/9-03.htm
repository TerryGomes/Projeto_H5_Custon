!Tablet of Vision:

Countless thoughts beyond comprehension once again sear painfully into your brain. Now the words of Naverius make sense. I know where the next Tablet of Vision is! It's somewhere to* the North of Giants Cave*. Someone is near the tablet has the Stone of Commune. It's hard to make out, but he seems to be riding something, and something else is bearing down on him from behind! And then the vision fades... I will go to* the North of Giants Cave* where the Stone of Commune is located.
