!Saint of Light Agnes:

I will fill the granary with this generous gift. Thanks to your help, these people can walk the path of light once more.%%
Now I can help you on your way. A woman named* Elkadia* told me of how one can step beyond his own limitations. You remind me of her.%%
Take this Stone of Commune to the Tablet of Vision,* south of the Tower of Insolence*. It can bring you new knowledge.
