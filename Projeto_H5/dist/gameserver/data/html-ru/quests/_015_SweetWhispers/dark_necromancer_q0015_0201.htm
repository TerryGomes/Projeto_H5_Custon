!Mysterious Necromancer:

Ah! You're looking for the elder too, aren't you? Lots of folks looking for him these days... This is getting old! Do I look like a street sign to you?

Anyway, past the Entrance of the Saints, you'll see the valley. Go to the deepest part of the valley and enter the cave. You'll find the elder there.
