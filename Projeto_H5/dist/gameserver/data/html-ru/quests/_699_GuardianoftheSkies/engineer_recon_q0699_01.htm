!Engineer Lekon:

I'm asking you this because you've proved that you have the qualifications to fly... Will you help me full time? It's been a struggle to maintain and repair Keucereus Alliance Base.

Finding quality help isn't easy in times like these, you know... I have a good feeling about you, though!
