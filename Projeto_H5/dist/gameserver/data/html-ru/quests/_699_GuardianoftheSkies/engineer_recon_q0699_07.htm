!Engineer Lekon:

You're back! Let's see here... Ah, you've brought quite a few *Vulture's Golden Feathers*. You must have succeeded in defeating *Master Rider Valdstone*, or have defeated a great many *Vulture Riders or Elite Riders*. Ha ha! This will put a dent in their plans. I'm delighted with your progress!

Here is the reward I promised you. I know it's not much compared to what you've gone through, but I hope it helps.

Say...you've got a real knack for this. Care to go back out and hunt some more?

[Quest _699_GuardianoftheSkies reply_2|"Sure."]

[Quest _699_GuardianoftheSkies reply_3|"No, I've had enough."]
