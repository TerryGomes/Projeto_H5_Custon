!Engineer Lekon:

Why haven't you left yet? Hurry!

Bring me the *Vulture's Golden Feather* as evidence that you've defeated *Master Rider Valdstone* and scattered his followers, the *Vulture Riders and Elite Riders*. You must defeat these pirates and protect the safety of our air space! You're not thinking of quitting, are you?

[Quest _699_GuardianoftheSkies reply_2|"Of course not. Have the reward ready."]

[Quest _699_GuardianoftheSkies reply_3|"I have another urgent matter to attend to."]
