!Elder Casian:

I understand. Your assistance has given me the opportunity to redeem myself. I don't know exactly where my research will lead, but hopefully to a better world...

We all must do what we think is best. Only time will tell whether our choices are good ones...

Thank you so very much for your help. May you be blessed by the gods...
