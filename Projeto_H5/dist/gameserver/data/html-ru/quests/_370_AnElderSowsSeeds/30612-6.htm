!Elder Casian:

How could you have  forgotten so quickly?

"Kranvel's Spellbook" consists of four chapters: *the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, the Chapter of Wind and the Chapter of Earth*. The contents will not be discernible unless you find all four chapters. Please, you must help us! We're counting on you!
