!Elder Casian:

In order to obtain the pieces of the spellbook, you must conquer the *ant recruits, ant patrols, ant guards, the noble ant and the noble ant leader*.

*Check carefully any scraps of paper you come across*. The pieces of "Kranvel's Spellbook" should be easy to identify.

The spellbook has four chapters: *the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, the Chapter of Wind and the Chapter of Earth*. The contents will only be discernible if you recover all four chapters.

This is a challenging task, but I think you are ready for it. May the divine blessing be with you...
