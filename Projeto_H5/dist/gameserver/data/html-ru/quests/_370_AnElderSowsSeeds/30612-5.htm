!Elder Casian:

How could you forget? You must slay *ant recruits, ant patrols, ant guards, noble ants, and the noble ant leader* in order to obtain the pieces of the spellbook.

*Examine any scraps of paper you come across carefully.* The pieces of "Kranvel's Spellbook" should be instantly recognizable.

You must find all four chapters: *the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, the Chapter of Wind and the Chapter of Earth*.
