!Dimension Keeper:

The guardians of ancient magic are *undead and demons* summoned by ancient shamans. They worship the goddess of death to protect their sacred area from the crusaders of light.

They're known as *lookouts, watchers, guards, monks, prefects, seers, archons, inquisitors, guardians, sages, royal guards, and preachers.*
