!Dinn:

Gods be praised! Now that I know that you are willing to help us, I finally feel like I'll be able to sleep soundly tonight.
According to a trustworthy source, the Elrokian thieves who raid our wharf all wear necklaces that contain a* dinosaur fang pendant*. Bring me those necklaces as proof that you have captured them; I'll reward you based on the number of necklaces you bring. If you bring back more than 100 necklaces, I can also give you the donations collected from the merchants here.

Please, whatever it takes, rid us of these troublesome thieves! As long as you bring me their necklaces, I'll make sure that you are well compensated for your time.

The Elrokian raiders have set up camp in the* Primeval Plains*. Travel south along this road, and I'm certain that you'll find them.
