Did you happen to lose the necklaces on the way back here? Or did you fail to actually catch any thieves? No matter what happened, if you don't have a *dinosaur fang pendant*, I cannot justify rewarding you. Let me make a suggestion: travel south along this road to the Primeval Plains. I'm confident that you'll have no trouble encountering thieves that way!
