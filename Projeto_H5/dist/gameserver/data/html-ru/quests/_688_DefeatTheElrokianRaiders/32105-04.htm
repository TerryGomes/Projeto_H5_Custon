You don't have enough items yet.
Please, whatever it takes, rid us of these troublesome thieves! As long as you bring me their necklaces, I'll make sure that you are well compensated for your time.

The Elrokian raiders have set up camp in the* Primeval Plains*. Travel south along this road, and I'm certain that you'll find them.
