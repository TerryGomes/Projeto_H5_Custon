Actually, I need a blueprint of the structure of the tower of the Steel Citadel. 
I have learned who possesses the information I need, but I can't get it on my own. 
Perhaps... someone like you could go into tower, find that blueprint and bring it to me. 
Apparently the *Demon Prince* and *Ranku* in the Steel Citadel have access to the blueprint I need. 
Please bring the *Ranku's Blueprint* to me, and I'll reward you very well. 

Oh, one last thing: take these raw ore. They might look rough, but they function just like other ore.
I think they will help you in this task.
