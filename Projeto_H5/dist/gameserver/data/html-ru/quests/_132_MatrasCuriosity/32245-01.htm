!Matras:

You know I am keenly interested in the magnificent structure called the Steel Citadel. 
I have been researching it, but strangely I have found no complete blueprints. 
It seems that it was built independently by a number of different parties... 
I am still searching for additional information, but without success.

Would you be willing to help me?
