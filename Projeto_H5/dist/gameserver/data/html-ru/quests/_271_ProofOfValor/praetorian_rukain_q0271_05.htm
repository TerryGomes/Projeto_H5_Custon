!Praetorian Rukain:

Tejakar Paagrio! My young brother, you came back alive! You have fulfilled your task well. It always makes me proud when I see a young friend returning with a fist tightly clasping fangs, with a battered body but a glowing eye!

Wonderful! Take this! It is a necklace made of wolf fangs. This is a token that shows everyone that you have the combative spirit and courage of a true Orc. Wear it on your chest with pride!
