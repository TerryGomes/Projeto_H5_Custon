!Praetorian Rukain:

I can't stand newbies these days! They still smell like milk, but they think they're so great! If only I were not a praetorian, I would knock some of these saucy rascals down with one blow and perhaps get their wits going.

Hey! Are you glaring at me, kid? You look upset because I disregard you! If you feel offended, why don't you train harder!
