Collector Yumi:

Very well. I had hypothesized before that there must be some single will controlling all the golems. Nothing else would explain their degree of coordination and their singleness of purpose. To find this being, we can track it from the signals it sends to control the golems. Take this. It is an *electric wave detector*. It should lead you to this being.
