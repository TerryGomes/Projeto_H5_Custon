Collector Yumi:

Ah, that's right. I was talking about the incident at the lab. There was a great explosion in the north wing of the lab. After that, everything was in chaos. A gigantic golem suddenly appeared out of nowhere, forcing us to flee. By the time we returned, all of the golems we had made began attacking us. Everybody has since left this area except me.
