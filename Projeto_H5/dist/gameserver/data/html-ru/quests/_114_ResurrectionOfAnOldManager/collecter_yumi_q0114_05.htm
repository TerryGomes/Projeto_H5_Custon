Collector Yumi:

Everything went smoothly for a time. The Bronze Key Guild opened the door that linked to Pavel's lab and dug up the excavator Pavel once used. Luckily, it was designed based on ancient Dwarven technology, so the Black Anvil Guild produced an Excavator Golem based on the earlier design. The Gray Pillar Guild made a strip mine with the golem, and everything was perfect... until the great explosion happened.
