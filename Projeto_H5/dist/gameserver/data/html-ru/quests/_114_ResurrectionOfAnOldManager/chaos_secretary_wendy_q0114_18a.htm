Wendy:

I remember flowers... It was very cold around the lab, so very cold. There were no flowers then. Master said he wanted me to see the flowers, and he said he would dedicate himself to making something he called the *"Weathermaster"*. Then one day, as I walked around with my friend, it was suddenly warm! There was a bright sun, and oh, so many flowers!
