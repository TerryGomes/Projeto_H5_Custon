Collector Yumi:

I'm here to investigate why the golems attacked us and how the explosion happened. Sadly, I can't even go outside and walk around. Speaking of outside, I heard there's a strange building in the south. Do you think you could investigate? If anyone is there, then I want you to get some information from them.
