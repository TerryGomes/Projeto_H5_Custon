Ah, you brought a Freya's Soul Fragment's which so I need!<br>
Thank you! Now my research can go farther, as I hoped. Ah, but allow me only to check up them, to guarantee that they are authentic... In my work the imitations meet too often. If this will be the real object, I will reward you, as well as promised.
