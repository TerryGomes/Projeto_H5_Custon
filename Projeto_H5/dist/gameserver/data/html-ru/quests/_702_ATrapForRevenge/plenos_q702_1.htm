!Soldier Plenos:
        
Greetings ally!

I suggest you a mission which can prove your strength. The mission is to hunt Dius, the Deadman of Destruction, and his subordinate Drakes over the skies of Seed of Destruction.

For further instructions you should go and see Soldier Tenis, the injured soldier who's in the center of Keucereus Alliance Base, and ask for advice.
