!Soldier Tenius:
        
Ah! Right.

It's about that hunt of my life. I hope you will be able to help me.

I got injured when went out to hunt Dius, but you cannot see Dius, the Deadman of Destruction, with an ordinary method.You should use the trap which I developed in order to lure Dius, the Deadman of Destruction.

The trap requires good meat to work, so I need you to bring *100 pieces of Drake's Flesh* to be used as materials by capturing his subordinate Drak, which appears over the skies of Seed of Destruction.

Hunt *Drak, Drake Wing, and Mutated Drake Wing* in the skies near Seed of Destruction. When you are done, come back to me.
