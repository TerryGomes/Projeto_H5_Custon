My thanks for your help! Go near the village entrance and hunt *Young Grey Keltir, Grey Keltir and the Dominant Grey Keltir* and bring me the *Grey Keltir's teeth*... Also, hunt the *Black Wolves and the Dominant Black Wolf*, and bring me *the Teeth of the Black Wolves* as well...

Once you bring back the teeth, I will pay you Adenas based on the number of teeth. You can also exchange *25* teeth for a useful item.
