I know very well where the dinosaurs live. If you leave this place with Kariachin's help and go up north, you will find a cave linked to an area of the Lost Nest.

Enter it and you will find the dinosaurs easily. Once among them, hunt <font color="LEVEL">Ornithomimus and Deinonychus</font> and gather their claws and bone fragments for the ritual. Once you have obtained more than two of each of them, return here. In the meantime, I will prepare another part of the ritual.
