!Mushika:

Very well. Then go to Karakawei and tell him that I sent you. He will tell you in detail what you must do in the Lost Nest.

Complete the task as Karakawei directs you and then return to me.

This is all I can tell you -- it is not entirely safe to speak openly of these important matters here.

Before you leave, take this. There will be a time when it proves useful to you, so please take good care of it.
