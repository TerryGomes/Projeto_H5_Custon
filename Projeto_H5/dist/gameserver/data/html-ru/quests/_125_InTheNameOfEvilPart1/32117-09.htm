!Karakawei:

Haven't you collected the materials for the ritual yet? We cannot begin until I have the claws and bone fragments necessary to summon the spirits of my ancestors.

Go to the Lost Nest and hunt <font color="LEVEL">Ornithomimus and Deinonychus</font>. Collect their claws and bone fragments; you must obtain more than two each in order for me to proceed with the ritual.
