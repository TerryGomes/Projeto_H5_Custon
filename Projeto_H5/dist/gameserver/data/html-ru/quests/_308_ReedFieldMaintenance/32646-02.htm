Do you happen to know about the old Reed Field? Silence or whispering... don't even mention those. For adventurers who have no place to hunt, the old Reed Field was just nothing but a field of rage.

So, the project is about using adventurers who have no place to go in sweeping this reed field. Isn't it beneficial for all since we can maintain the field of reeds and they can take the rewards?
