Alright! The mission is to hunt down those wicked monsters in field of reeds. They are the biggest obstacle in our plan to turn this area into a development zone.

Those monsters are the *Mucrokian Fanatic, Mucrokian Ascetic, Mucrokian Savior, Mucrokian Preacher, and Contaminated Mucrokian*. Also, the *Mutated Mucrokians* are those who were awakened by the plot of the Purified Ceremony Hall.
 They are fiercely violent. Since they are the worst obstacle, I will give you twice the reward.

Please don't show them any mercy!
