!Dark Knight Mordred:

Oh, I should've known that Waldstein wouldn't join the Death Lords! This should stop any actions against Waldstein...%%
By the way, congratulations on completing the Pilgrimage of the Tablet of Vision! You surely earned the right to be a Hell Knight. If I could, I'd transfer you myself right now, but unfortunately...%%
You're not quite ready for a class transfer. Come back when you're older!

(Only a character of level 76 or above may transfer to the Hell Knight class. Don't abandon the quest until class transfer is complete.)
