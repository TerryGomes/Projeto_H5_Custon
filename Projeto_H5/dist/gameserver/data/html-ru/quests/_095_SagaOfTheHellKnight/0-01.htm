!Dark Knight Mordred:

Hmm... So, you want to be a Hell Knight, eh? I'm glad you came! Well, you'll have to prove yourself by completing a mission! Have you heard of a Dark Avenger named Waldstein? He was sent out some time ago in pursuit of the* Death Lords*, and hasn't been heard from since. Please find out what happened to him! It's been rumored that he actually* joined the Death Lords*! Our guild is under a lot of pressure to deal with this matter, one way or the other. Will you investigate this for us?%%
There have been reports that Waldstein was seen in the vicinity of the* Tablet of Vision*. You may need to undertake the* Pilgrimage of the Tablet of Vision* if you're going to find him...
