!Guard Bayard:

Good work! Show me the report.%%
Hmm... This confirms Waldstein was seen with the gang of Death Lords!%%
It's believed Waldstein is making the Pilgrimage of the Tablet of Vision to become a Hell Knight.%%
To complete the pilgrimage you must commune with each of six stone tablets. You must have a Stone of Commune for each tablet. Upon completion of all six you will gain a level.%%
Follow Waldstein's footsteps to find him. Here's the first* Stone of Commune*. Use it to commune with the Tablet of Vision where he was last seen. The path to follow will then open to you.
