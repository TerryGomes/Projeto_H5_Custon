!Table of Vision:

I can no longer commune with this Tablet. It seems that there are no marks of Waldstein, so finding the next Stone of Commune is the best option. You sense that the next stone is being held by the* Guardians of Forbidden Knowledge near the Tablet of Vision in the northeast part of the Valley of Saints*.
