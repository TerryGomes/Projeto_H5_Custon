The highest quality honey can be found in the beehive, but the insects that guard it are actually wasps! These wasps store honey in a organ called a honey sac inside their body. This is by far the finest honey, but it's extremely scarce! To make a pie I'll need at least 100 honey sacs! Get them by killing *wasp leaders* and *wasp workers*.

Get *100 honey sacs* and bring them to me.
