!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:

A voice comes out of the sphere in a pleading tone:

I was once a human like yourself. A powerful spell perished my body and my very soul was trapped in this place. For several hundred years, I've been working here as a gatekeeper. They have even taken away my memory and therefore I don't even know what kind of person I used to be. The only thing I remember is that I need to open the gate to the Lord of the Seal.
