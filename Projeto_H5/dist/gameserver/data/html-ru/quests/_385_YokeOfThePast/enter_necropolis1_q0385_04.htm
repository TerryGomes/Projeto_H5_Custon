!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:

The followers of ancient magic possess *scrolls of ancient magic* containing forbidden magic power. If these scrolls were to fall into the wrong hands, it could cause quite a disturbance. I cannot let this happen. Please recover the scrolls of ancient magic from the ancients in the dungeon...

Will you do this for me?
