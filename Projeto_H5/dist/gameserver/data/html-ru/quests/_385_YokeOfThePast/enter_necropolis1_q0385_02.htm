!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:

The sphere speaks again:

I was once a human like yourself. A powerful spell perished my body and my very soul was trapped in this place. For several hundred years, I've been working here as a gatekeeper. They have even taken away my memory and therefore I don't even know what kind of person I used to be. The only thing I remember is that I need to open the gate to the Master of the Seals.

I could use your assistance, but you should get more experience first... Then, promise me that you will come back and help me.

(This quest can only be undertaken by a character of level 20 or higher.)
