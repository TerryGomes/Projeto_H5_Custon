!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:

By borrowing the power of Einhasad, Shunaiman, Emperor of the Elmoreden Empire has sealed the power of ancient magic in this place. In order to guard the entrance to this place, the emperor placed a human soul into a sphere and made it into a gatekeeper.

I don't remember why he needed a human soul to act as his gatekeeper. Perhaps that was to subjugate it, and make it obey the Master of the Seals.

However, the power of ancient magic, dormant until now, has started to awaken. My magic power is too weak to restrain them... Therefore, there is something I would like to ask you.
