!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:

Give me the Scroll of Ancient Magic and step back...

... the light of purification. It is cast on the shadows. The flames of soul... burning up the darkness...

It's done. The magic is removed. Here is the *Blank Scroll* I promised you.

This Blank Scroll will be helpful to you when you trade with the *Merchant of Mammon* who appears in the sacred area once in a while.

If you would like to collect more Blank Scrolls, enter the sacred area, slay the *guardians of ancient cult* and bring me back more *scrolls of ancient magic*.
