!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:

The Guardians are *the undead and demons* summoned by the wicked shamans who serve the goddess of death. These creatures are bound here, to protect this sepulchre from the Cross Army of Light.

They call themselves *Lookout, Watcher, Guard, Monk, Overlord, Shaman, Consul, Inquisitor, Guardian, Elder, Court Guard and Preacher.*

But you must not harm Nephilim, Lilim, Gigant and Lilith. They are soldiers of the gods, most holy warriors, and you dare not raise your sword against them.
