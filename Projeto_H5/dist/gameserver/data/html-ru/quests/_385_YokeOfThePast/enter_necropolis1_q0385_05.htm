!Gatekeeper Ziggurat:

Good choice! Now go to the dungeon, slay *the guardians of ancient cult* and bring back the *scrolls of ancient magic*.

When you bring me the scroll, I will remove the magic power it contains and turn the scroll into a *Blank Scroll*. A Blank Scroll is the only reward I can offer you.

Have you heard of *Merchant of Mammon* who often appears in the castle area? He will be very interested in a Blank Scroll. You will find out more when you meet him. It won't be easy to find him though...
