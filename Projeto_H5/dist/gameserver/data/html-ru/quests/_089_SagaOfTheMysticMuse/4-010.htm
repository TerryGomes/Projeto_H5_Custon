!Silver Feyshar:

I missed Arkenias, but I robbed him of the Stone of Commune! Either he was hiding it to try to interrupt, or he's guarding the tablet to prevent you communing with it.%%
He didn't put up much of a fight, he could easily have handled us both.%%
This should finish your class transfer. See you later, I must follow Arkenias to find out the truth.
