Just one more thing... The Tablet of Vision can't be read alone. Only by using the* Stone of Commune* can you decipher it. The Stone of Commune acts as a medium, and you absorb the information directly into your body! This is known as* communing with the stone tablet*. At one time Stones of Commune were quite rare, but they've been turning up in lots of places lately! I fear that there are unseen, foreign hands at work here...%%
You should go and talk to* Magister Alminas* in Goddard Castle Town. He'll know best what you should do next... Take a copy of the guild bulletin with you!
