!Silver Feyshar:

Let me introduce myself. I'm Feyshar, not Alminas as you may remember me. Somebody is hindering the transfer to Mystic Muse, so I was investigating in disguise. The real Alminas is probably back to Goddard Castle Town by now.%%
As I suspected, Grand Magister Arkenias is behind it! You showed up while I was finding out the truth. You saw him in disguise before.
