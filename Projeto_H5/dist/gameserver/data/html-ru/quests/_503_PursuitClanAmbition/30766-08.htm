The scepter of shunaiman... It's been a long time since I laid my eyes on it. Its color has completely faded.

Although it has preserved itself for a long time, unlike its appearance, it is a very fragile object...  For example, if I hold it while standing on a stone floor and drop it...

Cling clang! It will break just like that... Hee hee hee hee...!

Destruction and chaos...  I am their embodiment. This kind of object is of no use to you.  That is why you were willing to hand it over to me when I asked you for it.

Instead, Iâ€™ll give you this. When was it...  a young king who was on his way back to his kingdom after meeting the lady of the lake placed this object in my care.  Take it with you when you leave.  At the point in time when I am destined to meet with you again, you who will be covered in blood, I will be waiting... You young tyrant!
