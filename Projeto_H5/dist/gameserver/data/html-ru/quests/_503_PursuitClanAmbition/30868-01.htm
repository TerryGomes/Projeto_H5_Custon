!Sir Eric Rodemai:

I heard about you from Gustaf Athebaldt.  I'm honored to get to work with you. Actually my father Sir Kristof Rodemai often talks about you. He told me that since you are the people who will achieve some great mission,I should watch you with close attention.  I would like to meet your clan lord as soon as possible.
