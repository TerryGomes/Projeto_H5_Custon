You really did a good job! You've gotten all the powerstones and nebulite crystals that I requested. I'll take a look...You take a look too. Wow! This is an art. An art, I say! Aren't they really exquisite? Compared with the technology of the ancient titans, the devices made by us Dwarf artisans are just children's toys. I really appreciate this. Thanks to you, our research in the new type of siege golem is back on track! I'll be able to show you the results pretty soon! Ha, ha, ha... You're gonna be impressed! That golem will be so dangerous that it shouldn't be used on just any castle!
