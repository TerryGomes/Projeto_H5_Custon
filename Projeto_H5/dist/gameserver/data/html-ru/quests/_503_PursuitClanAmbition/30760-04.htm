!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

The royal authority at the center has already been shaken to the core. And the authority of lords and aristocrats has fallen a long time ago. The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out a few years ago in Dion is the proof. In the mids of this chaos, several small power circles are growing their strength trying to grasp a big piece of the pie for themselves.

I believe that a young and energetic lord like yourself should lead in a new era.  Rather than counting on the old royal circle of influence, I would rather lend my power to new blood like you guys. I'll be your strong supporter. What do you say? Would you like to join forces with me?
