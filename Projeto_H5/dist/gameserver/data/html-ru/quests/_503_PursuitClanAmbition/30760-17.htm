!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

You have to find the *'Scepter of Judgment'* that everybody is trying to get a hold of. Before other forces snatch the relic, we should make it our possession.  Please hurry up and go see *Sir Eric Rodemai in Aden Castle Town*. Give him the letter I gave you. Then he will tell you what you need to do.
