!Head Blacksmith Kusto:

Magpie brooch...? This...?! How could Kurtz...!

Boo, hoo..! It's from the Magpie Brothers! He really was going around with those ill-bred guys and ended up like this...He drug the respectable title of Master Raider through the mud... What an unfortunate fellow...!

But even though he disgraced himself, still can't ignore the blood connection. Thank you for bringing me this from my dead brother. As thanks, I'd like you to take these *coins*. This is an expression of gratitude from the Black Anvil Guild.
