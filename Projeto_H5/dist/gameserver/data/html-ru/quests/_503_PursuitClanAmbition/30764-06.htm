Umm... These aren't coins from our guild! It appears that you've helped someone from the Black Anvil Guild. OK... Us Dwarves never forget a favor. I'll give you something that will be helpful to you. It's a *recipe* on which is written the method for fixing a broken and otherwise useless titan powerstone. You'll be able to make good use of it if you've got a Dwarf in your group. OK, good luck!
