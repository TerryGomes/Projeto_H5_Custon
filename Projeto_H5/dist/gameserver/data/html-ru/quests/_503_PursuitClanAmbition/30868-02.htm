!Sir Eric Rodemai:

I heard about you from Gustaf Athebaldt. I'm honored to get to work with you. Actually my father Sir Kristof Rodemai often talks about you. He told me that since you are the people who will achieve some great mission I should watch you with close attention. I would like to meet your clan lord as soon as possible. Because of the promise our ancestors had made in the past -

I will tell you about it later -- We, the Rodemai family have worked for the Athebaldt family for the past three generations. This time, we have been ordered to recover the Scepter of Judgment, relic of the ancient kingdom, which may actually be a mere legend, and we are inquiring into rumors about its whereabouts from everywhere.
