!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

Yes!  You remind me of myself in my youth.  But this world is not that easy to conquer... Oh well, you will learn to accept your share of challenges as you go along. Since I can believe that you do have what it takes to be a capable leader, things will work out one way or another. Now, please help me with the work I am trying to embark upon.
