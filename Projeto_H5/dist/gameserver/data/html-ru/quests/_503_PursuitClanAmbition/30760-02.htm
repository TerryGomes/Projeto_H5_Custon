!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

The royal authority at the center has already been shaken to the core. And the authority of lords and aristocrats has fallen a long time ago.The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out a few years ago in Dion is the proof. In the midst of this chaos, several small power circles are growing their strength trying to grasp a big piece of the pie for themselves.

I believe that a young and energetic lord like yourself should lead in a new era. And I would like to lend my power to people like you and your clan. Although you are already well trusted by so many people that I guess you wonâ€™t need my backing that much...

(Only level 4 clan can carry out this quest.)
