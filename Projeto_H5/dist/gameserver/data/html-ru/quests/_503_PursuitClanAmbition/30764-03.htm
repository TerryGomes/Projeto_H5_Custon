Ah! Yeah, the thing you guys have to do is bring me titan's powerstones. To do that, you'll need to go to Titan Cave which is in the south of Aden.The degenerated titans that are living there are curious creatures that have grafted a mechanical device to their bodies as ancestors of the ancient titans that had achieved a glorious civilization. Even if their heads have become strange, they are still incredible beings with a physical strength that has no match. However, folks such as yourselves can still find a way to deal with them.

*If you kill the titan soldiers or border guards,* you can get the *powerstone* from the mechanical device that is fitted on their bodies. Note that a broken one is no use at all... So you've got to bring a powerstone that is in good condition. And we'll also need *nebulite crystals* that are used as fuel for the powerstones. They look similar to gems that shine brightly but you'll still be able to recognize them easily because of the special luster they emit.We'll need *ten each* of powerstones and nebulite crystals. OK, please do your best.
