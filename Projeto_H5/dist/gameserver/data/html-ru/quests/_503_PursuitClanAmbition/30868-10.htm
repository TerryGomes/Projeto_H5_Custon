!Sir Eric Rodemai:

Sir Gustaf Athebaldt is an uncle of King Amadeo Cadmus.  Considering the order of inheriting the throne, he has the sufficient right to assume the royal throne. Although he is pretending that he is not interested in power so that he can dispel people's suspicion about him, he is in reality controlling many cliques in the background and by undermining the power of the king, he is planning to take over the throne in the end.

He is a sly and scary schemer.

The dragon's eggs you have collected will be used to create his own private dragon army.  The gigantic siege weapons he has commissioned dwarves to create will also be used for his own personal gain...

This is all I can tell you about this subject.  Please go see Sir Gustaf Athebaldt.
