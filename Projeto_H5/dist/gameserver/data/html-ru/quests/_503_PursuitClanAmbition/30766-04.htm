!Witch Cleo:

You, who will walk the path of a king, listen to me carefully!  Blood and honor,war and death, ambition and power... these will all come your way in the future. They were plotted on the indices of the universe a very long time ago and now they are rushing towards you. In the near future, you will be forced to make a choice.  To stand up against the waves of fate and shatter them or to ride the waves of fate calmly... all will be your choice.
