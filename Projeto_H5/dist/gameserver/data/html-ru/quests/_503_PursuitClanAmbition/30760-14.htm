!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

Although Baltazar is not well recognized in Dwarven society, actually he is a very capable artisan. I believe that his research efforts will soon bear fruit. Your clan will be of great help to him.  And some day the results of his research may be of great help to you as well...
