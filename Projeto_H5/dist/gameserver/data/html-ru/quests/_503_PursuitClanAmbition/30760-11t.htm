!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

I heard from Martien that the first stage of your work in Giran has been completed. But another work has come up that I need to ask your clan to get involved with... In a few days, I would like to meet with your clan lord to discuss the work.  Please relay my message to him as soon as possible.
