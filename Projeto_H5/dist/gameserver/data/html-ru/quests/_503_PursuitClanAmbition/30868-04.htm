!Sir Eric Rodemai:

One cannot guess the ages of these three women. They always disappear after leaving some incomprehensible strange remarks. Everybody calls them witches. My father has been strangely obsessed by their remarks. When you were young, did our family prosper after following advice from witches? I donâ€™t know the details of what happened.  Honestly, I don't want to have anything to do with such blasphemous people. Would you be willing to go see them on behalf of me?  I heard that  *Clio*, the youngest of the three sisters is near this village. If you go to the Eastern part of the village and cross a bridge, you will be able to meet her.
