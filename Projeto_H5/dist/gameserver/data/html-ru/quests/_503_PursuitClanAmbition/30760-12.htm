!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

When you study history you come to a realization that the supremacy of any time period has always been in the hands of those who were in the possession of advanced technology.    Therefore, from long ago, I have been providing support for the Dwarf's "Black Anvil" guild.Their main enterprise is to research the science of giants in the ancient times.  Although real life applications have not yet been made ...they often create strange devices such as an airship that can float in the air, and steel giants that can be controlled at will..., I believe they are called golems?

Among them, there is a dwarf by the name of *Baltazar* to whom I especially provided much help. Although he is not well recognized in Dwarven society, actually he is a very capable artisan. I believe that his research efforts will soon bear fruit. Now, Baltazar is experiencing some problem in the research he is currently conducting and asked me for help. He said that it has something to do with a new style of golem...  You can hear about the details from Baltazar in person. He should be currently located at  *Hunters' Village. Carry this letter with you and go see him.
