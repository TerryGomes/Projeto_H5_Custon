!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

The royal authority at the center has already been shaken to the core. And the authority of lords and aristocrats has fallen a long time ago. The bloody uprising of peasants that broke out a few years ago in Dion is the proof. In the midst of this chaos, several small power circles in every part of the country are growing their own strength trying to grasp a big piece of the piefor themselves.

I believe that a young and energetic lord like yourself should lead in a new era. If your clan can distinguish itself a little more, I can join forces with you and support you...
