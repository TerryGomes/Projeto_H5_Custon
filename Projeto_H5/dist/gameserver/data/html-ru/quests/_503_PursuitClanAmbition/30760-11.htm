!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

I already received the report from Martien.  I gave a little bit of money to the families of the dead dwarves as a token of condolence.  It is a shame... although they were just hired dwarves, they lost their lives while working for me. This is truly sad and regrettable.

Any how, with this, we have come to the end of the first stage of our plans... Now I have something else that I would like you to work on.
