!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

Hmm... aren't you too honest. If you are that way, you will never be able to come into possession of the things you desire to have. People especially a leader who is in charge of many followers should know how to alternate between the use of one's external face and internal face. Well, anyhow...  since I do trust your potential... now I am going to tell you about the work that I would like to get your help with.
