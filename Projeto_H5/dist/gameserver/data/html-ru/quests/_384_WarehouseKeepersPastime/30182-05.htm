!Warehouse Freightman Cliff:

Good choice! After you bring the *Warehouse Keeper's Medals* to me, I'll let you *play bingo*. If you win, I'll give you an unclaimed item as a reward! You never know... you may obtain a high quality weapon or armor!

According to our rules, *you can bet either 10 or 100 medals*. Therefore, you should bring back at least 10 medals. Of course, if you bet 100 medals, you'll have a better chance of winning a higher-quality item.

Ah, Go and see *Warehouse Chief Baxt of Hunters Village*, he will also let you play bingo. He feels responsible for allowing the robbery to happen, and has offered to help with the recovery of the medals.

There is one more important thing. Based upon the footprints, hair samples and statements from witnesses, the evil creatures that attacked the cargo wagon were *rotting golems, gigantic monster eyes, konzur bats, konzur bat lords, tulben, hunter gargoyles, dragon bearer chiefs, dragon bearer warriors, dragon bearer archers, dustwind gargoyles, thunder wyrms, carinkain, weird drakes, grave guards, cadeines, sanhidros, connabi, bartals, luminuns, innersens, nightmare guides, nightmare keepers, and nightmare lords*.

Good luck!
