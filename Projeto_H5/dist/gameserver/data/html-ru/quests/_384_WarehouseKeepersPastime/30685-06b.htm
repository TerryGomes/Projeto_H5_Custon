!Warehouse Chief Baxt:

As Cliff told you, you must slay the *rotting golem, the gigantic monster eyes, the konzur bat, the konzur bat lord, the tulben, the hunter gargoyle, the dragon bearer chief, the dragon bearer warrior, the dragon bearer archer, the dustwind gargoyle, the thunder wyrm, the carinkain, the weird drake, the grave guard, the cadeine, the sanhidro, the connabi, the bartal, the luminun, the innersen, the nightmare guide, the nightmare keeper, and the nightmare lord* and bring back the *Warehouse Keeper's Medals* they stole. Then, like Cliff, I will also let you *play bingo*. I feel somewhat responsible for the shoddy security provided for the freight wagon, and have decided to help with the recovery of the medals.

If you win, I'll give you an unclaimed item as a reward!  You never know... you may obtain a high-quality weapon or armor!

According to our rules, *you can bet either 10 or 100 medals*. Therefore, you should bring back at least 10 medals. If you bet 100 medals, you will have a better chance of winning a higher-quality item.
