!Warehouse Freightman Cliff:

Being a warehouse keeper can be very boring, just sitting around waiting for people to bring items in. *Warehouse keepers think of different ways to amuse themselves.* I usually pass the time playing *bingo* with other warehouse keepers. On my day off, I visit the warehouse keepers in the village and play bingo with them.

I recently had a problem at a game, and would really like to ask you to help me, but I'm afraid you aren't yet up to the task. Come back when you've improved your abilities.
