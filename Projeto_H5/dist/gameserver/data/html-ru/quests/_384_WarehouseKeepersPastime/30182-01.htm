!Warehouse Freightman Cliff:

Being a warehouse keeper can be very boring, just sitting around waiting for people to bring items in. *Warehouse keepers think of different ways to amuse themselves.* I usually pass the time playing *bingo* with other warehouse keepers. On my day off, I visit the warehouse keepers in the village and play bingo with them.

But we find the old rules of the game too boring...
