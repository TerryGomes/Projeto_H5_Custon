!Warehouse Freightman Cliff:

We bet items! Working as a warehouse keeper, all sorts of items become available to you. Many items in the warehouse go unclaimed, therefore I never lack for things to wager.

*Lately, I've been betting Warehouse Keeper's Medals.* These are awards issued by the Iron Gate Guild to warehouse keepers according to their productivity. Please don't tell anyone I'm wagering with them!

I've actually had a problem with this lately...
