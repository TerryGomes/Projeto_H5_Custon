! Holy Tomb:

After seeing the coffin. Have you noticed the inscription:

Here lies the Holy Sopina who devoted his life to the kingdom Elmoreden, and death - the goddess of Einhasad. Yes, she will sing a song of praise saved it. Yes die in mortal agony, turned away from the holy doctrine, or trying to get her strength.

This is not a real grave Solina.
