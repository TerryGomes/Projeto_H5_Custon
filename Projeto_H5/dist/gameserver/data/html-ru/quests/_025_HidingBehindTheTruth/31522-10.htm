!Mysterious Wizard:

I was preparing my magic.%%
It's not easy to conjure an army without corpses,%%
so I opened the door to the netherworld to steal the army of shillien.

While I was preparing,%%
Lidia took Rose's corpse.%%
You know the story from there.%%
I conjured Triol, and Triol made Lidia the Lord of the Forest of the Dead.%%
In the meantime, I started some experiments.
