!High Priest Agripel:

Don't be angry with me!%%
No matter how much power a Mystic possesses, he can't fight the great powers that move this world.

You know everything that happened in the Forest of the Dead.%%
Perhaps you know something that I don't.

*You still can't do anything about it!*

Truth alone cannot change the balance of power!
