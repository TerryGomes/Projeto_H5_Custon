!Maid of Lidia:

I was hoping we would meet again.%%
I forgot to tell you something very important.

My body may be gone, but now I can live my own life and follow my own fate thanks to you.

Hardin controlled the missing piece of my memory, but now it's complete.%%
He no longer has any influence over me!

I feel I got back my *real self*.%%
For that I am eternally grateful. That's what I wanted to say.
