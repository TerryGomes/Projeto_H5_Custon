!Captain Gilbert:

Go and slay orcs and werewolves that live on Talking Island, and bring back proof of their deaths. Prizes will be awarded according to the amount of proof that you bring back. Bring back the *feather orc amulet, werewolf fangs, or the orc's necklace* that orcs of fighter rank carry.

This task is not just a simple hunt, but an official announcement that, under the will of the lord, Talking Island is now part of the Aden Kingdom. Therefore, the aggressors who have invaded our land must be punished accordingly. All who participate in this hunt are representatives carrying out the will of the lord, and must carry this symbol of the lord at all times.

May the blessings of Einhasad be with you.
