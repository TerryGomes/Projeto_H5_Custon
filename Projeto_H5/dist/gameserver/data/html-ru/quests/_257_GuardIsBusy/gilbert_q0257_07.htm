!Captain Gilbert:

Well done. I will reward you for every piece of proof you have brought me. This is a reward given to honor the fighters who have faithfully carried out the will of our lord.

The lord's decree is still valid. There is still more adena left for rewards. Will you continue your hunt, or will you quit?
