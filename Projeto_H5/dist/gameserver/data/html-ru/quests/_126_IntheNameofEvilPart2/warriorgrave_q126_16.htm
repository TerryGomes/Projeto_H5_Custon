!Warrior's Grave:

The only hope is for you to become an Elrokian warrior, the one destined to wield Gazkh!

But wait! Gazkh is no toy to be picked up on a whim. It is as dangerous as a serpent, as powerful as fire itself! You must prove yourself worthy to be its owner.

Stranger, I see that you are already wise and brave. But that alone is not enough. If you wish to travel this path, there is one more task you must perform.
