!Warrior's Grave:

Stranger, why have you come to this forgotten place? Why do you raise up your voice in prayer?

Your desire to see me was so strong that it called to me across the black chasm of death, summoning me back to the world of men. What do you seek here?

[Quest _126_IntheNameofEvilPart2 warriorgrave_q126_4.htm|"I have been told that I might gain the wisdom I seek by praying here."]
