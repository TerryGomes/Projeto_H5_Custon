!Asamah:

Amazing! I am bewildered by hearing all that you have endured. Listening to your tale just now, I can't help but wonder if you are the one the prophecies speak of, the one destined to save our Elroki tribe and restore us to glory.

The Warrior's Oath you invoked is so ancient that we have lost the specific wording... It is clear to me that an ancient Elrokian warrior's spirit is within you. I hear and see the proof of this, but still cannot bring myself to believe it!
