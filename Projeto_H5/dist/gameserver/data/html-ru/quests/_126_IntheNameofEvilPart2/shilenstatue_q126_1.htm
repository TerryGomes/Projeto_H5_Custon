!Shilen's Stone Statue:

I am the seal stone, the gatekeeper set to watch over Sailren.

I am also an avatar of Shilen, who was the mother of this island and the first daughter of Einhasad and Gran Kain.

I ask you, you who are imbued with the spirit of an Elrokian warrior, who you are and why you are here.
