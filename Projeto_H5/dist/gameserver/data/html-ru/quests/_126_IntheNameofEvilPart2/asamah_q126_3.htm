!Asamah:

In fact, we have been able to use this opportunity to make sense of the few fragmented pieces of our history. As a student of that history, it has been very rewarding for me. 

But we have stumbled upon a mystery surrounding the sacred axe, named Gazkh. Sadly, our wisdom and strength are not sufficient to unravel the full mystery by ourselves.

But our prophecies tell us that an outsider, chosen by fate, can succeed when we are without direction. Please... I ask on behalf of the Elroki people: Will you help us?
