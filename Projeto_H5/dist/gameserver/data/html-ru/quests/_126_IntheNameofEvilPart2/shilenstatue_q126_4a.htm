!Shilen's Stone Statue:

Fool!

In the past, Shilen required her Elrokian warriors to take a sacred oath. Only then did she grant them the ability to wield Gazkh. In Shilen's stead, you must swear the oath to me.

If you refuse, you will never be able to wield Gazkh. Consider carefully! Do you wish to continue?
