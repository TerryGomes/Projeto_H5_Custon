!Chuta Kaimu:

O Shilen!

Let this broken sentinel return to its master's side!

Travel to a place where the thick trees lean against a cliff and hold their hands together.

To a place where the Elrokian warriors of old cast off their worn bodies and left on the journey from which no man returns.

Were it within my power, I would already be with them!

Oh, my silver-armored master...
