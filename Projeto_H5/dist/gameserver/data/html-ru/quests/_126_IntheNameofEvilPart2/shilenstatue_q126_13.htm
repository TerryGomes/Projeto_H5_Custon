!Shilen's Stone Statue:

I have allowed the ancient Elrokian warrior's spirit to enter your body. Now you are a master of Gazkh! As long as the Elrokian spirit is within you, the Gazkh will serve you.

Remember, your loyalty is now to Shilen and Shilen alone!

In her stead, I command you, faithful warrior, to return to the Elrokian village and find the help you require to restore Gazkh.
