!Chuta Kaimu:

With my body, the sacrifice of other Gazkhs, and the efforts of Shilen, we locked Sailren deep in the Lost Nest.

But our shattered fragments are now buried in the cold ground or lodged in the skins of the dinosaurs themselves, and the magical seal has failed.

With it, the power to contain the evil is failing.

A broken bowl cannot hold water, so how can a broken ax hold power?
