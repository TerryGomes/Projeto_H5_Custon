!Ulu Kaimu:

You called me a gift of the gods, a blessing to the warrior's hand.

You charged me to carry out the sacred task at your side.

Aieee! My shattered and scattered body. Now the entire Lost Nest is my grave.

My master!

I still hear the song you sang to me as we rode into battle.

Why am I imprisoned in this darkness? My lost master...
