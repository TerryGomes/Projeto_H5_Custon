!Mushika:

You are indeed filled with curiosity! Very well, then. Listen carefully and I will read to you the part in which the password is hidden. The contents of <font color="LEVEL">"Traces of Living Beings from Ancient Times"</font> is fairly well known to any scholar of mythology or history.

"... In the days of old, when the circle of the gods was broken, countless races were spawned from that circle. The greatest of them were the gods themselves; the next greatest were the Giants. And the gods gave the Giants authority to rule over the world."

All scholars know this story, but in these latter days men wonder what has become of all the creatures brought forth into the world at the breaking of the circle.

Although they had subjugated all the races of the world, the Giants seemed uneasy in their rule. Legend has it that they then created a mighty army of Orcs. But no one knows their purpose... There must still have been something or some creatures they considered a threat.

But what kind of creatures could threaten Giants in the safety of their mountains? More importantly, what became of these mysterious creatures?

I read this document over and over again, but I never thought the password was hidden inside.

I didn't know that this book was really a secret document written in ancient secret passwords -- like others, I read it only with scholarly interest.

But although this seems to be like any other document, through proper decryption we can discover its hidden meaning.

Legend has it that our ancestors once shared their secret documents in this way, but I've never seen such a thing before.
