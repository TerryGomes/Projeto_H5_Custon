!Shilen's Stone Statue:

Do I speak recklessly?

Shilen cannot bestow Gazkh on you now, and it is impossible to find an intact ax.

But if you are truly so willing to wield Gazkh and go into Sailren's nest, there should be a way.

[Quest _126_IntheNameofEvilPart2 shilenstatue_q126_11.htm|Ask what kind of way that is.]
