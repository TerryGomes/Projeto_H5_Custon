!Shilen's Stone Statue:

Oh, is that right? I have sensed the energy emmitted by Sailren had become stronger these later days and wondered if this ancient evil was simply waiting for its chance to strike.

Sadly, the seal stones can no longer completely hold him. I have prayed to Shilen to show me a solution.

Now, with your arrival here, I think our gracious mother has answered our prayers. It may be possible now to defeat it.
