!Shilen's Stone Statue:

Elrokian warrior! You have proven your courage and loyalty by passing all the trials I gave you. Receive, therefore, the ax created from the sacred water, Gazkh.

And know that from this time on you are sworn to follow my commands, the chief of which is to fight until your last breath to prevent these vicious dinosaurs from unleashing chaos on the world of men. Use this power wisely and well, or risk my righteous judgment and awful wrath.
