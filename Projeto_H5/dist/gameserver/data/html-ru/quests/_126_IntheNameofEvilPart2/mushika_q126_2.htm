!Mushika:

My heart leaps for joy at this unexpected clue! I never expected news of the ancient weapon, Gazkh, from an old document like this.   Not even a scholarly tome, at that! But in this ordinary book, <font color="LEVEL">"Traces of Living Beings of the Ancient Times,"</font> lay hidden the ancient Elrokian password... This discovery will help us reconstruct a long lost part of Elrokian history.

Most importantly, we now have this vital clue about the whereabouts of the Gazkh fragments. They must be found -- are you willing to help us do so?
