!Warrior's Grave:

Yes, now that I see it clearly, I certainly recognize it. Ah, Gazkh! From the time Shilen bequeathed it to me it never left my side, not even in slumber. Even after death, I wandered for a time searching for it. And now I see that, like me, it is only a broken remnant of what it was.

This is truly a bittersweet reunion. The memories rush back... But alas! Those times are gone, never to return.

But how is it that a stranger to these lands should bring this here, you who are not even an Elrokian warrior?
