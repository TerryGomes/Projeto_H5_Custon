!Asamah:

Shilen commanded my Elkrokhian ancestors to rule over the dinosaurs, using powerful magic to control and restrain them. It was the peak of Shilen's glory, and the world owed her a debt it could never repay.

But the other gods envied Shilen, and sought a chance to discredit her. At last she was seduced by her father, Gran Kain. Great with child, she was punished by her enraged mother, Einhasad.

Einhasad cast her from the continent, installing in her place as the goddess of water the weak and timid Eva. The primitive creatures who called her mother were suddenly abandoned, forever disrupting the balance of this island.

As a result, we Elrokians were forced to migrate to these Primeval Plains to escape the mindless fury of the dinosaurs.

When Eva became the goddess of water, it was the single most unfortunate thing to befall our tribe up to that time. Shilen's misfortune continued from that day onward, and eventually she became slanderously known as a goddess of evil or a goddess of death. Some historians also began describing her as the avatar of evil.

But I have heard that other, less-biased historical documents depict Shilen as a victim of Eva's insatiable jealousy. They say that not only did we lose our wise and strong goddess, but that all the suffering and chaos in our world is a reflection of Eva's spiteful heart.
