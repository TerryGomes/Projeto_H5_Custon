!Warehouse Keeper Norman:

Our guild, The Iron Gate, is involved with various reconstruction efforts to restore Gludio Territory from the devastation of war.

We've gotten the Lord's permission to begin reconstruction in this area...

But monsters have begun appearing in the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds where we get many of our important construction materials...

Other factors have led to a shortage of resources in the manor. The Lord is seeking adventurer's help.

When you have enough power, we could use your help!
