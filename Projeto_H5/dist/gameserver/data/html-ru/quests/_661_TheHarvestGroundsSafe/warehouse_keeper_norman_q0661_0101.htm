!Warehouse Keeper Norman:

We of the Iron Gate Guild are currently participating in various reconstruction works to restore Gludio Territory from the devastation of war...

We've obtained permission from the Lord to start a construction project in this area.

We've been having problems with monsters rampaging through the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds that produce our construction materials, so we're not making much progress...

Other factors have led to a shortage of resources in the manor. The Lord is seeking adventurers to help us solve this problem...

Will you help us rebuild Gludio Territory?
