!Priest Bastian:

Hello! I've been expecting you!%%
Don't look so surprised! You must have come to me because of the power of Stone of Commune you feel from me? I got this one from Agnes a while back. Don't you wonder how she got it and why she gave it to me? If you knew her, you would understand!%%
While you were away, there was an accident in Goddard Castle Town. Agnes provided food for the townspeople, and after the accident, everyone, including myself, came to rely upon her.%%
The stone you seek isn't perfect. When she gave me this one, she said she needed a more powerful one.
