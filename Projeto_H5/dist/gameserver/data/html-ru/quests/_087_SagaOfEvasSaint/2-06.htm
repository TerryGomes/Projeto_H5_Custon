!Saint of Light Agnes:

Many, many thanks! I will put this food in the warehouse and give it to people at dinner time and from there, lead them to the Path of Light. Thanks to your help, I can now give happiness to these people. Your noble sacrifice will not be forgotten.%%
Actually, if I recall, you came to me for the way to go on. Before you, someone called* Elikia* came to me to talk as well. It appears that you both are walking through similar paths. So I will share with you what I shared with* Elikia*.%%
This is the Stone of Commune. I heard if you bring this to the Tablet of Vision, you will get additional knowledge. To visit the Tablet of Vision with this stone, go to* the south of the Tower of Insolence*.
