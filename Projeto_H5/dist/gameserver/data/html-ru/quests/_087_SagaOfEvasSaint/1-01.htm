!Chef Duncan:

What can I do for you, priest of light?%%
Saint Agnes sent you? Well come on in, then! How are things with Saint Agnes?%%
Ah, yes, the starving people! She has a heart of gold, that one! I'll always do anything I can to help her. I'm glad you came!%%
I'll need something to keep the food fresh on the trip back to her, however...
