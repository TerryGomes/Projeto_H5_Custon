!Warehouse Keeper Raut:

Good, I like your frankness.

Actually, I have a nuisance of a nephew. One day the rascal was teased by his friends because he had bluffed that he could sell items to the monsters of* Dragon's Valley*. And then the next day, he left with everything in the warehouse! Since he is the only child of my deceased brother, I have no choice but to find him. Please go and find him for me.

Also, this is a scroll of return. Tell my nephew to use it so he can return immediately. I'm sorry there is only one.

Well then, good luck on your journey.
