!Master Toma:

Shut up and bring me *five Honey Jars* at once! 

You're such an idiot! First you must kill the *hunter bear*. The Honey Bear will appear afterwards. Conquer the Honey Bear and search him with the *spoil*. Then you'll find the Honey Jars.

You can find many hunter bears at the place where two divided coastlines meet, at the west entrance of the Abandoned Coal Mines. It's on the Map.
