!Priest of the Earth Zimenf:

I sincerely truly thank you!! Now I can prepare for the ritual, I say! I sincerely, truly thank you!! I must hurry to prepare the ritual. I say, the high priest will scold me if I am late.

*(I see Mion is sending you on errands with her brother as bait ... hee hee hee ...)*

What? Oh, nothing. I was just talking to myself. Please tell Mion thank you. Karna Mafra!
