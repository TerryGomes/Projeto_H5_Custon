!Master Toma:

Who are you?

Oh, a letter from Mion?

Hmm... So you want to be a Scavenger?

Do just as I say.

This body yearns for something sweet. What do you think?

My friend says that if you kill a *hunter bear,* you can obtain an amazing honey. Please bring me just *five Honey Jars*. Knock down the Honey Bear and rummage through with *Spoil* and bring back the honey.

First of all, find the *hunter bear*. The Honey Bear appears sometimes after killing a hunter bear. Where is the hunter bear, you ask? Then listen well to what I have to say. If you go straight up toward the north at the west entrance of the Abandoned Coal Mines, there is a place where two divided coastlines meet. There are a lot of the bears there. Take a look at the Map for more details.
