!Warehouse Keeper Raut:

I'm sorry but you must do it.

Do you know what that fraud Toma gave me when he said he would repay his debts? It is none other than the *token of the Scavenger* that you want. Now do you know why you must listen to my request? Then let me tell you what you need to do.

I have a nuisance of a nephew. One day the rascal was teased by his friends because he had bluffed that he could sell items to the monsters of *Dragon's Valley*. And then the next day, he left with everything in the warehouse!

Since he is the only child of my deceased brother, I have no choice but to find him. Please go and find him for me. Also, this is a scroll of return. Tell my nephew to use it so he can return immediately.

Well then, good luck on your journey.
