!Collector Pippi:

Well, I will tell you ... I don't know anything about the test.

But really, I don't think that the test is important. The one really important thing, if you ask me, is *tithing*. Do you know how much money the guild spends on managing just one member? From guild uniforms to insurance and information fees, to giving good information to guild members ... a lot of money is needed. To obtain those funds, the most important thing is tithing, giving ten percent of what you earn ...

Ah ... How to become a Scavenger? Only *Master Toma* can confirm it. His sister *Trader Mion* knows where he is, so ask her. I'll write you a letter of introduction.
