!Ghost of the Railroad Engineer:

Ah, that doesn't surprise me. Did any of the ghosts show you a dream fragment?

What they showed you was our forgotten dream, the dream we tried to realize even after our death and failed, our hopeless dream...

Well, that's how the world is. If you fail at achieving something in your lifetime, it is better to give it up than to carry the regret to your grave. What can I do as a ghost, other than to bother people like you?

My poor friends... they had no idea that it would come to this.

So, do you want to exchange that dream fragment for our keepsake? Or do you want to give up now? I am warning you in advance, the dream fragment is all but useless... *If you tell me you want to give up, then I will simply fade away...*
