!Officer Klemis:

The monsters of the Bistakon clans look like mammals, but don't be fooled. Their claws and teeth are unnaturally sharp and strong, and they aren't shy about using them. Also, they travel in packs, so unless you like being outnumbered, you should recruit a few friends to help.

If you can kill <font color="LEVEL">15</font> each of the <font color="LEVEL">Bgurent, Brakian, Groikan, and Treykan</font> variants, that should be enough to clear the region for a while. And with that, good luck.
