Ah, the Reptilikons. I'll brief you on them.

The monsters of the Reptilikon region are basically enormous reptilian beasts. They are just as vicious as the other beast clans, and tend to be poisonous to boot. Trust me on this - don't go alone. That said I hope it goes well.

If you can kill <font color="LEVEL">20</font> each of the <font color="LEVEL">Turtlelian, Krajian, and Tardyon</font> variants, we can declare that region safe a while.

Good hunting!
