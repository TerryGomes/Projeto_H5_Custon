!Officer Klemis:

The Cokrakon clans resemble birds, but believe me, they aren't hunting worms. These monsters can emit sound shockwaves that can shatter your bones, paralyze all your nerves and muscle tissue, and leave you basically unable to move quickly. If Kookaburras give you nightmares, these things will leave you unable to ever sleep again. Do yourself a favor, when you go on the hunt, bring others with you.

If you can kill <font color="LEVEL">20</font> each of the <font color="LEVEL">Kanibi, Kiriona, and Kaiona</font> variants, the region will be clear. You should get started. I wish you well.
