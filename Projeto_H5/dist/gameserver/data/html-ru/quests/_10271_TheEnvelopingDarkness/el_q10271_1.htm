!Soldier El

Oh.. what do you need?..

The mission? Ok, listen.

I had been on escort duty for the experts who went to investigate the Seed of Destruction. The group had successfully sneaked into the stronghold, but while they were gathering intelligence they were discovered and attacked by Dragon Horse Soldiers. 

The experts and their military escort got wiped out. Only I could, heavily injured, escape the slaughter. There was one of the experts, by the name of *Medibal*, who carried on him the records of the investigation.

If you're agree to help me, you should bring *Inspector Medibal's Document* safely back to the base of the *Keucereus Alliance*.

So, what's your decision?
