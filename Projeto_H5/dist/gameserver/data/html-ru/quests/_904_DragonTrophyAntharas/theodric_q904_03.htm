!Theodric:

Your arrogance is not the best choise to deal with the *Land Dragon Antharas*. His power is beyond the measure.

And your fate is all about meeting him face to face.

Hs is *immoral*, when he dies, the proceess of reborn begins, so there's no possibility to wipe him out. Only killing him over and over again will stop his influence.

But this will last until the new rebonrned Antharas will be back.
