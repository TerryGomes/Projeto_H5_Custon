!Chamberlain Saul:

A true lord's power rests on the loyalty and love of his subjects, not the force of his arms. To win the support ncessary to rule this land, you must earn the trust of the local forces. Allow me to gather some information, and I will be able to tell you who to meet. I will return shortly, my lord.
