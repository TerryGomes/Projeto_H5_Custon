!Chamberlain Saul:

As you know, Giran is the center of commerce. Therefore it should not surprise you that the most influential person in this territory is Warehouse Chief Gesto, whose organization controls the logistics necessary for trade. I think you should go see him and earn his trust, my lord. I have heard that he has a problem, and no doubt he would be grateful for your help.
