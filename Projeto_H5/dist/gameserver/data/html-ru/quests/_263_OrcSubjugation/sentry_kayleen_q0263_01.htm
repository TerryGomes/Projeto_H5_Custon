!Sentry Kayleen:

I don't know why, but the *Balor Orcs*, who had been hiding in the *Misty Mountains*, have started to invade our forest in groups. It is unpardonable that the Balor Orcs, who used to be our slaves, have forgotten their place and dare to challenge us!

The *Assassin scouts* are following the movements of the *Balor Orcs* at this very moment. As soon as accurate information is received, *Tetrarch Vellior* will give the command to strike. When the time comes, you should also participate in the battle! We must launch a full-scale attack and drive the *Balor Orcs* out of our woods!
