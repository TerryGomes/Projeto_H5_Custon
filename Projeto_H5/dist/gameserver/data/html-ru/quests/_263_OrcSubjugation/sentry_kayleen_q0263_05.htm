!Sentry Kayleen:

You have fought very well. In the name of *Tetrarch Vellior*, I will give you a reward for every *balor orc* that you strike down. Those who fight on behalf of the race of darkness will reap a rich reward for their bravery.

But the battle is not over yet. The foreign invaders still lurk in our woods! Will you go back into the battlefield, or will you stop fighting now?
