!Sentry Kayleen:

Go to the woods and strike down any balor orcs you meet! Someone with your skills can easily take care of the *Balor Orc archers*, but the *fighters* and *leaders* are much stronger than regular *balor orcs*, so do not let your guard down!

*Tetrarch Vellior* made a proclamation just a few days ago. The more *balor orcs* that are killed, the greater reward he will give. Slay the *balor orcs* and bring back something to serve as proof of your deed. The *archers* carry *feather amulets*, while the *fighters* and *leaders* wear a *necklace crafted of bone pieces*. If you collect these and bring them to me, I will give you a reward according to the number of items you present.

Excellent! May you go forth in the name of *Shilen* and present fear as dark as the abyss and a death as cold as the deep lakes to those invaders who have violated our land!
