!Sentry Kayleen:

I do not know why, but the *balor orcs*, who had been hiding in the *Misty Mountains*, have started to invade our forest in groups. It is unpardonable that the balor orcs, who used to be our slaves, have forgotten their place and dare to challenge us!

According to the reports of the assassin scouts, the balor orcs are not simply coming to pillage, but are preparing for a large-scale migration. A sudden invasion of the balor orcs ... Perhaps those cunning *Elves of Light* are behind this!

These woods are our home. We have defended ourselves every time the greedy *Humans* or the *Elves of Light* invaded us. We cannot allow an inferior race like the balor orcs to threaten our woods! All the *Warriors* of our race must come together to punish them in the name of *Shilen*. Would you like to participate?
