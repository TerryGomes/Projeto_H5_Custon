!Sentry Kayleen:

Why are your hands so clean when they should be stained with the blood of the *balor orcs*? Go quickly into the woods and dispose of the *balor orcs*! Go forth in the name of Shilen and take fear as dark as the abyss and death as cold as the deep lakes to those invaders who have violated our land!

You do not want to give up, do you? Do you not hear the *balor orcs* on the battlefield outside of the village mocking you? Would you turn and run from their taunts?
