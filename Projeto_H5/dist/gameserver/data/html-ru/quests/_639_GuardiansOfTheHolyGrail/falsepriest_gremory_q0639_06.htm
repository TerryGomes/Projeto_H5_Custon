!Priest Gremory:

Go to the *Room of Splendor* and *pour a measure of water into the Holy Grail. Then pour the water back into a jar and bring it to me.* We can test the water to determine if the Grail is the real thing or not. Be careful when you do this; the room may be guarded.

Oh, another thing. The Room of Splendor is locked, and you'll need a *key to enter it.* Some of the monks carry a key to that room; I suggest that you overcome of one of them and take his key.
