!Officer Tepios:

Then I will tell you about your mission.

You must enter the Hall of Erosion, which consists of a circular passage connecting 8 rooms. In 4 of the rooms you will encounter something called <font color="LEVEL">Unstable Seed of Life</font>. It protects the area from the undead.

Naturally, the undead wish to destroy this Unstable Seed of Life in order to occupy this area permanently. Your mission is to protect it for the time specified.

You can prevent their attack from intensifying by <font color="LEVEL">keeping the destroyed tumors in the other 4 rooms in a deactivated condition</font>. Do you understand?
