!Guard Coleman:

Captain Kurtiz says that in order to wipe them out completely, the Taik orc seeker and the Taic ork supply leader must be stopped from giving supplies to the monsters.

But alas, our guards are having a hard time dealing with their forces. The captain has ordered me to find someone who can kill them for us.

You seem capable of doing it. Are you willing to help us? We will pay you a generous reward.
