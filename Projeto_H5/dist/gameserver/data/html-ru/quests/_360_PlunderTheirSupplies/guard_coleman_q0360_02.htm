!Guard Coleman:

Have you witnessed the current condition of the Cemetery?

The final resting place of kings, aristocrats and heroes has fallen into ruin and been overtaken by hideous monsters. Our neglect tempts our ancestors' wrath.

At Captain Kurtiz's direction, we have begun to try to drive out the monsters, but we have not been very effective so far.
