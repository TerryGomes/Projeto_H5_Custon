!Priest Kanis:

They say that a monster named *Baylor* rules over the *Water Dragon's Cave*.

I believe that Baylor guards the place where the Shamaness is being held captive.

If that is the case, you will only be able to reach the Shamaness by defeating Baylor.

That creature is said to be far stronger and more frightening that ordinary monsters, so please be careful...
