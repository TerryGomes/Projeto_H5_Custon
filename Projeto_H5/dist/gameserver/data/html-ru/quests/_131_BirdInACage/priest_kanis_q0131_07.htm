!Priest Kanis:

Recently, however, the Shamaness began to act strangely, and the Water Dragon stopped coming.

Then monsters that had never appeared here before attacked the Crystal Oracle, along with many of the Water Dragon's servants -- including even the Crystal Golems that had previously protected us.
Many people were killed or captured, including the Shamaness...

(Kanis looks like he is reliving the experience.)
