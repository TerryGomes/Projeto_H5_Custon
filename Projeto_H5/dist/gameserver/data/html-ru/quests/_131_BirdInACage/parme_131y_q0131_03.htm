!Water Dragon's Shamaness Parme:

(As she listens, the Shamaness continues to tenderly hold her head in her hands.)

Uhh... Uhh...

...

Ahh! I remember everything now.

Thank you very much.

There is so much to tell, but...

It would be best to leave this place first.

I will go to a secret location to take care of a number of tasks for the Water Dragon that cannot be delayed.

I am sorry to not be able to tell you more, even after you saved me.

But it is that important...

I will teleport you outside.

(The Shamaness begins to write a letter.)

Please deliver this letter to *Kanis*.

We must go now!

(The Shamaness concentrates for a moment and then begins chanting a spell.)
