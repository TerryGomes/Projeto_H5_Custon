!Water Dragon's Shamaness Parme:

(Suddenly, an ethereal and sorrowful melody beings to flow from the Echo Crystal you received from Kanis.

The Shamaness body is engulfed in a light, and her eyes come back into focus as she clutches her head and shrieks in pain.

A moment later...

(She seems to recover, although still appears somewhat disoriented.)

Who...who...are you?

And where... am I?
