!Priest kanis:

Ah, the notorious Demon Beleth... So the Shamaness reports in her letter.

She says that she was due to be transported shortly to Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island.

You succeeded in rescuing her in the nick of time!

This could have been an even worse disaster...

Apparently, though, several others from the Oracle, including several high-level priests with the weakened power of the Water Dragon, where taken to there.

Once Innadril's Elven Army has been summoned, it will likely have to mount a major rescue operation.

The Shamaness was able to describe in general terms the presumed location of Beleth's stronghold.

I now have many things to attend to.

Oh, this is one of the Oracle's treasures -- the Shamaness has instructed me to give it to you with her gratitude.

Please speak to me if you are interested in Beleth's stronghold on Hellbound Island...

Thank you again for all your help.

I will pray that divine blessings rain down upon your path.
