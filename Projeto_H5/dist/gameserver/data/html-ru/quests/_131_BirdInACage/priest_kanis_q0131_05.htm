!Priest Kanis:

In the past, the Water Dragon rose up because of the conflict between the Water Dragon's anger, which was fueled by Shilen's influence, and its original heart.

The Innadril Elves and the goddess Eva, who felt pity for the Dragon, used a special method to commune with it. They selected and Elf maiden to serve as the Dragon's Shamaness in order to provide it with some comfort.

The servants of the Water Dragon build this Crystal Oracle for the Shamaness.
