!Sorcerer Harris:

Recently, the severe storms damaged the roof of the temple in several places. We are in the middle of repairing the roof right now, but it is harder than we thought. Plus, all our tools are old and dull, making this an even slower task. The high priest has personally asked us to hurry with the repairs, and I am worried that progress is too slow.

A few days ago I went to the village Blacksmith and asked *Altran* to create new tools for us. I cannot leave the temple right now, as I have to prepare for the services, but could you go to the village and bring the *tools* back to me?
