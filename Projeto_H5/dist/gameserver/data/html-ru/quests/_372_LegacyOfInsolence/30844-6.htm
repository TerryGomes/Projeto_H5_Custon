!Warehouse Keeper Walderal:

OK, Listen carefully. Bring to me the blueprints of the Tower of Insolence. There are 13 of them.

Take *Ancient Papyrs* from *Corrupt Sages, Erin Ediunces, Hallate's Inspectors, Platinum tribe Overlords, Platinum Guardian Prefects and Messenger Angels*. You must open those papyrs in order to see their contents. All i want are the blueprints...you can keep anything else you find on them.

Bring me all of them and I'll give you a recipe for a pair of gloves, shoes or a hat. Is that clear? Now, please, get going.
