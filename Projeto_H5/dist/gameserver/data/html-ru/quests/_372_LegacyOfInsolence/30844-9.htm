!Warehouse Keeper Walderal:

So, you've found another things?

Well, I know of some other people that could be interested in such findings.You should visit *Magister Desmond, Claudia Athebalt, Antique Dealer Patrin or Trader Holly.* All i want are the blueprints...

Bring me all of them and I'll give you a recipe for a pair of gloves, shoes or a hat. Is that clear? Now, please, get going.
