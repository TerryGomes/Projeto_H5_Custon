!Orim of the Shadow:

Then take a look at this. It is something that I found in the Cruma Tower one day. A cube made out of a mysterious substance. They say that the Wizards of the ancient kingdom called it a 'spirit container' because it could hold a dead person's spirit in it. That is how they tried to keep all the great scholars and philosophers' knowledge and experience.

This box right here contains the spirit of Magus Aklantoth in the days of Elmoreden. Recently, he woke up from his 1,000-year sleep. It is faint, but clear enough... I hear his voice, calling me... He has promised to teach me all he knows in magic if I free his spirit from the box. You can always rely on a Wizard's word... So, what we need to do is open this box, and we'll have access to the secrets of black magic from the age of the empire.
