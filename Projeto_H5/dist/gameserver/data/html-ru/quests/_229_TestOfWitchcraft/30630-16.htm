!Orim of the Shadow:

Just at the moment when Zeruel was about to be freed, I mustered all my magical power and activated the sealing spell again. But if I lose my concentration for even just one second, all the other demons, not to mention Zeruel himself, will pour out from the box.

The one who holds the key to seal the box permanently is Zeruel himself. We must take the key back from him. And lock him back in there. To do so, we need 2 things. One is the*Sword of Binding*, and the other is the *Soul-trap Crystal*... If we can put these 2 things in our hands, we'll be able to bring Zeruel down and lock his spirit back into the box.

You'll be able to get Sword of Binding from *Sir Klaus Vasper in Gludin*. I will write you a letter explaining the situation. But I bet he shall not lend the sword to people who are studying Witchcraft... Do whatever you can to win his trust and borrow the sword from him.

As for the Soul-trap Crystal, *Master Iker* of *Giran* is taking care of it. Go and ask her to lend you the crystal. She also has hostile attitude to Witchcraft, but if she sees that the situation is desperate, I believe that she will help us.

Meanwhile I will perform the searching spell to find out the locations of Zeruel. Please hurry! Although Zeruel is still weak, once he gathers his strength back, no one will be able to resist him!
