!Orim of the Shadow:

I command thee, devil trapped in the prison of spirits! I speak in the name of Gran Kain, ruler of all darkness that thou shall return to where you come from!

Chain of heaven which ties up the evil creatures of shadow, I order you in the name of Einhasad's light, may the sealing of the seraph restrict the evil spirit forever!

The spell is now done. Hurry! The key!
