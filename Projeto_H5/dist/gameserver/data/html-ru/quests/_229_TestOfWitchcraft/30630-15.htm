!Orim of the Shadow:

How could it be! This is the box which I believed to be the Cube of Aklantoth... The Cube which I trusted would contain the spirits of the ancient scholar...  Was in fact a prison in which the demons were captured in ... Moreover, it is *Zeruel*the Malrukian prince, Monarch of Drevanul, the bloody angel...

It is all my fault! I was too confident! I was careless! My impatience is to blame!
