!Trader Alexandria:

Ah! The jewels from last week's auction! They are truly exquisite, crafted with impeccable detail in the late empire fashion. They belonged to *Trader Nestle of Gludin* who requested that they be put in this auction as a relic from the ancient empire.

They were all sold at the last auction. I must check the account book to see who bought them...
