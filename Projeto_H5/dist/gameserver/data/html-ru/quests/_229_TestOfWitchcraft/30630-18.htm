!Orim of the Shadow:

Sword of Binding! And the Soul-trap Crystal! You acquired the 2 holy objects! Now, if only we find out where Zeruel is...!

My searching spell wasn't exactly a success, so I couldn't find out Zeruel's location exactly, but I have a clue of where he might be. I think he is now in the northern part of Dion Castle Town, *somewhere near the Floran Village*. It is likely that he is *dwelling inside a human body*.

When Zeruel reveals himself, fight him and kill his body with all your might. *But, remember. The last stroke must be done with Sword of Binding*. Then you must seal his spirit with the Soul-trap Crystal. You can do it. Please hurry.
