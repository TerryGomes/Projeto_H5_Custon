!Orim of the Shadow:

The *necklace of Master Iker*? How obstinate of her, indeed! I shall get rid of this necklace right away. The Wizards of the Ivory Tower have been watching us all along with this necklace.

Thank you very much, anyway. And sorry, also. Because of my arrogance and carelessness there could have been a great disaster. Thanks to you, we could barely escape the situation. I am the one to blame. I couldn't read the demon's tricks and I was blinded by the greediness for knowledge... I can't blame the devil itself either. He was just true to his dark instincts of provoking death and destruction. After all, the Wizard who couldn't control that power, is to blame...

I wish I could let you meet with Hardin right away, but I am too ashamed to see his face. To restore my dignity, I shall concentrate on my meditation for a while. Now, I shall give you the *Mark of Witchcraft*. From now on, the road of the Magus will open in front of thee.
