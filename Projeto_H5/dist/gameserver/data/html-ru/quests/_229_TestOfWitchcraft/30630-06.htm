!Orim of the Shadow:

It is very true that actions speak louder than words, and practice is more important than theory. I have no doubt that your resolutions are truthful but I can't totally believe you until you prove yourself.

I will give you the opportunity to prove your faith and resolution. *Will you help me with my research for a while?* I will see during that period how serious you are, how intense your faith is, and above all, how passionate you are about the hidden truth. What do you say? Will you help me? Will you assist me in unveiling the secrets of black magic?
