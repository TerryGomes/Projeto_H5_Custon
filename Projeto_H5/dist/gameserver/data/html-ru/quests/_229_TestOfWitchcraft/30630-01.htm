!Orim of the Shadow:

The Wizards of the Ivory Tower and the Priests of Einhasad threaten us by saying that the studying or using of any Black magic is extremely dangerous. It's just another branch of magic, but they blame it as a filthy and immoral action.

Those who never understand the truth that exists on the other side as well, are detesting. I think you are one of those. You didn't understand the truth of darkness properly and neither do you make any efforts! Go away, now!

(Quest available only for Wizards, Knights, Palus Knights above level 39.)
