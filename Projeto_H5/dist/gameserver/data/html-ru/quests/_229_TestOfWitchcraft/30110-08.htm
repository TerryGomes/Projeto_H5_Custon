!Master Iker:

Once again the short-sightedness of you dark sorcerers has brought disaster! Your careless use of dark magic has loosed a devil upon us!

In any case, the monster Zeruel cannot be allowed to roam free. I shall lend you the *Soul-trap Crystal*. Seal the devil behind the doors of purgatory once again and return the crystal to me. This necklace has the power to deflect evil, it will also be of help to you. Now go!
