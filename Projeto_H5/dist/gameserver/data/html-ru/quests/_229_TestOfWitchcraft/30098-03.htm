!Trader Alexandria:

My records are very detailed. Three jewels were put on auction.

There were originally 6 pieces in the set, But the others were not in the set and were sold separately.

The first jewel was sold to *Master Iker*. He is one of the members of the Mages' Guild of this village. The second jewel was sold to *Trader Lars from Dion Castle Town*. And the last jewel was sold to a *Dark Elf lady named 'Kaira'*. She is one of the few Dark Elves who live in this village.

I'm not sure, but you seem to be in something of a hurry. If need be, I will lend you my account book. You should meet the owners first, and ask Trader Nestle of Gludin about the origin of the jewels.
