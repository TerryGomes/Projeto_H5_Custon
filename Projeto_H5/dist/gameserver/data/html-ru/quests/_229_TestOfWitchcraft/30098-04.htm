!Trader Alexandria:

Jewels received by Mr. Nestle... I didn't realize they were so valuable!

As I told you, the 3 jewels that I put on the auction were sold to *Master Iker*, *Trader Lara* and *Dark Elven Magister Kaira*... You should meet them first and then ask *Trader Nestle* in *Gludin* about the source of the jewels.
