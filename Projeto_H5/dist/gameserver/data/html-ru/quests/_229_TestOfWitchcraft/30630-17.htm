!Orim of the Shadow:

To lock the devil Zeruel back into the box, we need to have 2 things. One is the *Sword of Binding*, and the other is the *Soul-trap Crystal*.

Sword of Binding belongs to Sir Klaus Vasper, and the Soul-trap Crystal is owned by Master Iker of Giran. Neither of them are in favor of Witchcraft, so it won't be easy win their cooperation.
