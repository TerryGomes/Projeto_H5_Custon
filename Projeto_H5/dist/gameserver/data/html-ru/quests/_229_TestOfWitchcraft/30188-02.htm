!Priest Vadin:

Did you complete the trial that I gave you? Let me remind you of the trial, you should kill the *Tamlin Orcs* and bring *20 talismans* as proof. If you complete the trial, I shall approve that your resolution and faith are firm, and give you the permission to use the Sword of Binding.
