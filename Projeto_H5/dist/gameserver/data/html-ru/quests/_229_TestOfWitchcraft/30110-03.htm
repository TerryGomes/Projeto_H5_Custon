!Master Iker:

All right, this is what I need.

First, the *Teeth of the Worm* that lives in the *Sea of Spores*. *20 of them* should be enough.

You must also bring me the the *Leto Lizardman's Amulet*. You can find the leto lizardmen in the *southern parts of Oren*. You must bring me *20 of these*.

And last, I need the *Stoneheart of the strengthened stone golems* that may be found near the *Ivory Tower*. I will need *20 of these*...

These are quite a few items so I've written them down for you.  Bring them to me and you shall have your jewel...
