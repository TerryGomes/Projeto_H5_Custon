Ha! An adventurer after my own heart... Don't try to satisfy your curiosity in ome guip, though.

If we make progress with these experiments, I'm sure all of your questions will be answered.

At this stage in my research, I absolutely require *Stabilized Ectoplasm*.

I have learned that it can be obtained from *Dark Elf Magister Errickin in Hunters Village*, but I cannot leave my experiment at the moment.

Will you go in my place, obtain it and bring it back here?
