!Magister Errickin:

Wait..did you say that you have come for Stabilized Ectoplasm?

There aren't not many magicians these days who deal with ectoplasm, which is composed of filthy and unpleasant souls..

Fortunately for you, I am one of them.

Ah, you undoubtedly will not wish to divulge to me yout purpose for this ectoplasm..

Well, I don't know what kind of necromantic magic you are experimenting with, but it must be a challenging task.
