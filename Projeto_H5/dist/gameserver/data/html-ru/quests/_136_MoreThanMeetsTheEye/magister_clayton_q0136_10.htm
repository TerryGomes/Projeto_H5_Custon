Oh, this is.. I don't know your purpose, but it looks as though you are seeking a new type of spell medium..

Ard a very powerful one at that..

It will be difficult, but I believe I can create it according to these specifications.

Unfortunately, I'm missing a key ingredient.

Apparently, in order to create it, I will require *5 Glass Jaguar Crystals*.

Interesting.. You see, I'm also keenly interested in new magic.

I will make you a deal. If you bring back 5 Glass Jaguar Crystals, I'll create an empty Book of Seal set for you at no cost.

In case you were unaware of it, Glass Jaguar is a malignant spirit in the shape of a leopard that guards *Plains of Dion*.
