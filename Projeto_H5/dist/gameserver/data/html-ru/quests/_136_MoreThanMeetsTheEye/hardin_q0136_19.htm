!Hardin:

(As soon as you drink the liquid, you feel stabbing pain inside your head. You can't seem to pull yourself together; you feel as though you are seeing the world from two perspectives, almost as through a mirror. Everything is spinning. Something fundamental in your soul feels like it is changing... You perceive Hardin as though at the end of a long tunnel. He is chanting an incantation... Time passes, and the world seems to steady as you come back to your senses.)

Success! Success!

You have done well, my young subject!

Now your soul is in a state in which you can erdure transformations.

Excellent!
