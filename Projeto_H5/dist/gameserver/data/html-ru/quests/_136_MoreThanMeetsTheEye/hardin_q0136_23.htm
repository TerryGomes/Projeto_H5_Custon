!Hardin:

(Hardin draws something and begins writing in the empty Book of Seal. Once finished, he casts some sort of spell on the Book of Sealm which flashes for a moment.)

Now take this Book of Seal to *Avant-Garde, the Transformation Wizard* on the 2nd floor of the *Ivory Tower* and you should be able to effect a transformation.

My thanks - you are a valuable assistant!

Since I'm as generous as I'm brilliant, I also wish you to take this...

Now I can plunge myself into research for a more varied kind of Transformation magic.

Farewell!
