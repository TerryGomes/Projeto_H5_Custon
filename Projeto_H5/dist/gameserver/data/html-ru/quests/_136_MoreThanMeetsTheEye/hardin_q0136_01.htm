!Hardin:

Among Shilen's creatures, there are those who are able to change their appearance to terrorize and attack people.

As a Necromancer, I'm naturally very interested in such abilities. What if their power could be utilized as a kind of magic?

...

Why do I research transformation magic?

At the core, it's because I'm curious about lifeforms and knowledge - I want to understand all knowledge, power and magic under the sun.

Ha ha...

...

Hmm...

Actually, this *Transformation Magic* is almost complete.

...

But in order to transform, the soul must first be prepared.

I'm still researching that final component...%%
Frankly, I could use some assistance.
