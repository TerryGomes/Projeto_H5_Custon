!Hardin:

I see that you have brought the empty Book of Seal. With this, all our preparations are completed!

While you were gone, I made an infusion using the Stabilized Ectoplasm and Mimir's Elixir.

Drink this and yur soul should be able to endure the transformation process.

Not nervous, are you? I suppose that technically you are the first to attempt this, but I'm entirely confident in my theory, and you seem a hardy, healthy specimen.

(Hardin holds out a bowl with a smoking, foul smlling liquid.)
