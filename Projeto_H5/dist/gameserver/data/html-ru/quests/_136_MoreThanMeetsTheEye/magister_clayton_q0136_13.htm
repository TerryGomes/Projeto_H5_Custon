!Magister Clayton:

Ah, you've brought all the Glass Jaguar Crystals! I will craft a blank Sealbook right away...

(Clayton begins to craft a blank Sealbook using a number of arcane materials.

After grinding down the Glass Jaguar Crystals, he liquifies them and uses the solution to engrave each side of the frame of the blank Sealbook.)

All right, it's all finished. I must admit that I'm very curious to discover how effective this magical medium will be. I suspect you're experimenting with a new spell -- I wish you success!
