!Magister Errickin:

How much are you willing to pay?

Hmm, you must be here on the orders of another..

No matter, In order to obtain Stabilized Ectoplasm, which is itself a rare item.

In fact, I have need of it as well..

You have the look of an adventurer, so I will strike a bargain with you.

Exterminate *the Mirror Ghost* and *the Mummy* in the *Forest of Mirrors* and you will be able to acquire *ectoplasms*.

Thirty ectoplasms will produce one Stabilized Ectoplasm. Bring back *35* of the and give me 5. Then I will make you a Stabilized Ectoplasm using this remainder.
