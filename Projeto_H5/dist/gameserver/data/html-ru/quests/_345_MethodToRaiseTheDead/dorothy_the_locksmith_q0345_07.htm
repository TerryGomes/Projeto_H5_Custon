The Dark Elves! I hate dealing with them, but there is a woman named *Xenovia* at their local guild who could be of great assistance to us. She always carries around a strange looking pot. I've heard that she uses it to summon the souls of the dead... If this is true, perhaps she can help us.. Take these bones to her. Or, if you have some other method of cummunicating with the dead, speak up!
