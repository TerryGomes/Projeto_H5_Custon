!Locksmith Dorothy:

I thought you might. I could use some extra adena as well. I think we will make a good team! Here's my plan...

Through great personal sacrifice I have located the treasure of the Pirate Captain Zaken! My former partners found it on Pirate's Island and were bringing a small part of it back to this village, they were slaughtered and devoured by crockians! I searched the site of the massacre for any remnant of the treasure but found nothing. Either they managed to hide the treasure somewhere, or it rests in the bellies of damned crockians!
