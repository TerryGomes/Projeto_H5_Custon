!High Prefect Garvarentz:

This necklace and statue prove that what you say is true. Last night I dreamed of an orc. His large body was covered with scars and he was drenched in what must have been his enemy's blood. He gave me this necklace...

Thank you, young traveler. Now I shall give the necklace to you. Use it carefully.
