!Antharas Watchman Gilmore:

My personal aide wore this key around his neck. He stood by my side during the battle with Antharas 1,000 years ago. He was the first-born son in his family... This key was very important to him.

I believe one of his descendants is living in *Giran Castle Town*. He has the family name of *Rodemai*.

I am bound to this valley so cannot go myself. Would you please take the key to Rodemai in Giran Castle Town? I will pay you for your trouble.
