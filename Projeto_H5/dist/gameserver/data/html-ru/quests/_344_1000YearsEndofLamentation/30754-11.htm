!Antharas Watchman Gilmore:

This crucifix belonged to one of the brave young soldiers who accompanied me here 1,000 years ago to battle the beast Antharas. At that time it shone like the sun. Now it looks so old and weathered...

He worshipped in a temple that stood where Aden Castle stands now. Please go to *Aden Castle Town* and take this crucifix to the temple of Einhasad. Show it to a *High Priest* at the temple, he will know what to do with it.

Even if I could leave the valley to travel there, an undead such as myself could never enter the temple. If you will do this for me I will pay you well.
