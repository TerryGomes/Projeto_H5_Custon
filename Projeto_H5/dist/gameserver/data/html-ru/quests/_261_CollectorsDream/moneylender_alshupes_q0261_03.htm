Currently, my main interest is in the large insects that I saw while traveling in the Human land of Gludio. As you would know if you studied history, when the Mystics of the Ivory Tower battled the Dark Sorcerer Beleth, also called a devil by the Humans of old, the strong magical energy which arose from their combat caused southern Gludio to become a barren plain and produced abnormalities such as ants the size of houses and spiders the size of buffalos.

In the last ten years, those great spiders have spread even to these Elven Woods. The tame creatures that have become accustomed to the care of the spirits and fairies of our woods are the perfect prey for those gigantic predators. Isn't that interesting? There are three kinds of giant spiders: crimson spiders, hook spiders, and pincer spiders. I don't have a preference, but I want to put into my hands a *giant spider trophy*. What you must do for me is to hunt the great spiders in the forest, cut off *eight legs*, and bring them back to me. It is a bit dangerous, but I will reward you generously for your efforts. Giant spiders are often found *near the Underground Fortress* or in the *Neutral Zone*.
