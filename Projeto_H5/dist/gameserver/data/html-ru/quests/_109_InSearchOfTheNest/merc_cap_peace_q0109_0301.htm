!Mercenary Captain Pierce:

I see... It is as I feared. He's dead!
Well, Thank you for risking your neck to track him down. We'll learn a lot from the intel he left behind. I'm sure that's what he would've wanted.
I'll keep my eye our for you from now on. For now, your work here is done. Speak with *Kahman* over there.
