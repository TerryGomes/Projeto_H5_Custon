Yes, yes, the evil is rising so we should fight even harder to keep balance.

I need you kill any monster in Seed of Infinity and Seed of Destruction you can find. Bring me their marks.

*Seed of Infinity* monsters will give you *Nucleus of an Incomplete Soul*

*Seed of Destruction* monsters will give you *Fleet Steed Troups Totem*

I will exchange those items in any quantity for Nucleus of a Freed Soul and Fleet Steed Troups Charm.

5 *Nucleus of an Incomplete Soul* = 1 Nucleus of a Freed Soul%%
5 *Fleet Steed Troups Totem* = 1 Fleet Steed Troups Charm

You can also bring me *Portion of a Soul* and *Breath of Tiat* and I will exchange it for Adena.
