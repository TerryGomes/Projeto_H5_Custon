!Magister Gauen:

Since the era of Shunaiman, the first emperor of the ancient Elmoreden Empire, the Mystic of the Ivory Tower have been researching the Sea of Spores. Around E.D 500 they constructed a force field tower which stopped the spread of the wretched sea. Their research has continued throughout the centuries

Althought the ancient barrier appears to be holding, the Sea of Spores continues to threaten us. A final solution to this problem must be found.
