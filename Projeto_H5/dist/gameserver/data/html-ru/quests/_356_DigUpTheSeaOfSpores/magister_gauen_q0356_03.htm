!Magister Gauen:

Frankly, I'm not sure. Up to now our research has been focused on sustaining and strengthening the magic force field tower.

However, it has become clear that we need a more permanent solution. For this we must return to the Sea of Spores itself.

We must shift our strategy to researching each individual spore, one by one.

We must study the colonies they build, how they spawn and the complex relationships between the plants and animals of the sea.
