I am no longer strong enough to even lift up a simple spear. But my hatred and will to seek revenge for those who killed my family is burning like mad. I beg you. Please seek revenge for me. When you bring me back *100 heads of the bloody X bodyguards* then I'll be able to die in peace.

Those Ol Mahums are staying in the *northern part of Oren*. You will be able to find their army post when you move farther north from the Corridor of Death of Kiran.
