!Mason:

Ascalon... It is a name that I have long forgotten... After I quit my job in the army, I got married to a beautiful woman called Lillian and we settled down in my hometown of Dion where we spent some happy and peaceful days.

And then one day, Grecia's army attacked and they killed my wife and children. Since then alcohol has been my only company. I often find myself crying by the riverside in grief of having to let my loved ones go...

Grecia's army is my lifelong enemy because they deprived me of my most precious thing, my family. *I swear that I'll revenge on them.* Will you help me?
