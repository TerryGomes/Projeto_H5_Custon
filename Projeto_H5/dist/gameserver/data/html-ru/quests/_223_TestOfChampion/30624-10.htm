!Veteran Ascalon:

Did you hear that not long ago, the guards and the soldiers fought against the medusas in order to protect Giran? They all fought with all their might and beat off the medusas, but during the fight many soldiers were infected by the deadly poison of the medusas. If we leave them like that they will all die very soon. And just imagine what will happen if the medusas make their second attack!  .. It is urgent that we find the cure...

Rather, an antidote to neutralize the medusa's poison. But even the Priests do not know how to make it. However, my old companion *Groot* will find a way. He used to work as a medic for the Iron Rose, and we were together in the battlefields for more than 10 years. I heard that he now owns a store in *Giran Castle Town*. Go and help him make an antidote.
