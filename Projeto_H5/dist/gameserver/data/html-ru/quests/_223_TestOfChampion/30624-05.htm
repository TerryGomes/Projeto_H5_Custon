!Veteran Ascalon:

Things have not changed so much since the time I was active as a soldier. Well, actually it has turned more chaotic and violent. The Blue Shark, the Black Lion, the Storm Blade, and the Iron Rose which I belonged to... Many troops are fighting in various regions with alien armies at the moment. There has never been a time in history when the aliens were so warlike.

All the leaders from each tribe, and the Masters, Sorcerers and Priests from many other guilds... They are all complaining that the situation now is very unnatural. Including the Hunters' Union, all the secret agents from each and every domain are looking behind the scenes, but for the moment we have no choice but to face the aliens and fight them in order to protect ourselves.

I wish to do something fruitful before I retire. Although I am too weak to participate in the war myself, I shall teach you. While you are taking the test, be sure to do exactly as I tell you to do. Am I clear!
