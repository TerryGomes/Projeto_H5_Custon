Thank you so much for gathering these ingredients for me.. Now I will create the antidote and deliver it to the temple and the guards. I felt as if I was growing too old to be of any use, but thanks to you I am able to contribute to the defense of my beloved Giran!  I am indebted to you... Here is a letter explaining my gratitude.  Please take it to *Ascalon*.
