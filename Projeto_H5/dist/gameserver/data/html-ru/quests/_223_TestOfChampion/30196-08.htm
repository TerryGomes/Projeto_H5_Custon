!Captain Mouen:

Congratulations on your safe return, Warrior. You have been of remarkable help in the defeating of the reto lizardmen who were threatening the town of Giran. People are already talking about your achievement. Now! Now take this letter with you and go back to *Ascalon*. I wrote in the letter about the battle here and your contributions in the victory. I bet that your teacher will be pleased to read it.
