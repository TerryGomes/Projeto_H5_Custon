!Veteran Ascalon:

There has been a message from the Town of Oren that it is about to be reduced by the *great army of road scavengers*. We need as many volunteers as possible to help protect the Town of Oren. Go and meet *Captain Mouen of the Town of Oren*, and follow his instructions. Always be reminded that the destiny of the whole kingdom lies in this battle!
