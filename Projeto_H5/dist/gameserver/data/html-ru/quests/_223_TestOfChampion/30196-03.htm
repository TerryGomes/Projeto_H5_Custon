!Captain Mouen:

*The road scavengers* are surely a nuisance if not 'a troop of outsiders threatening our kingdom' as my teacher said. They are plundering near the trade routes which connects Oren and Giran and the damage is serious enough.

Go to the  *Corridor of Death* and wipe them out, for the purpose of carrying out the teacher's command as well as getting rid of those 'pains in the ass'. During the fight be aware of the possible attacks from the *road collectors*. If you bring me *100 heads * I will write a letter describing you as the hero who saved the kingdom. I am pretty sure that your teacher will be pleased to read such a letter...
