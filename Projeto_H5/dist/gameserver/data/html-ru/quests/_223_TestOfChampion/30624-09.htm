!Veteran Ascalon:

You have returned! How was Mason? Please tell me in detail. 

...You say with your mouth that he is living happily, but the expression on your face says something else. Tell me the truth!

...What! Never did I imagine that he would be living a lonely, wretched life after losing all his family during the assault of Grecia... Perhaps his agony would be much lessened by now, since you have completed his revenge.

A Warrior must share the pains with his fellow, but still we cannot stop fighting. It is time for you to fight once more.
