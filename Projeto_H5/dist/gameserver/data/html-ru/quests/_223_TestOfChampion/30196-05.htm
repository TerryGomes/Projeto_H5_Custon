!Captain Mouen:

We're in trouble! *It turned out to be that the road scavengers that you got rid of were merely an instrument of the leto lizardmen!* There is news that the leto lizards are planning a large scale attack on Giran Castle. I guess that Ascalon was right. We must attack them first before they attack us! Many troops have already been sent. Please join them in the fight!
