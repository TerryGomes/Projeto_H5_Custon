!Captain Mouen:

Go to the *Corridor of Death* and wipe out the *road scavengers*. During the fight be aware of the possible attacks from the *road collectors*. If you bring me *100 heads * I will write a letter describing you as the hero who saved the kingdom. I am pretty sure that your teacher will be pleased to read such a letter...
