!Veteran Ascalon:

Good! Then first, go and visit my old friend *Mason*. He was a comrade of mine. We used to fight together in the battlefields in part of the Iron Rose. Although he has retired now, I am sure he is informed more than anyone else about the invaders who are threatening the townsmen of Dion. Perhaps he might even pick up a spear and head off to the battlefields, stimulated by your young spirits...

I heard that Mason, the master of spears, is living happily with his family *somewhere in Southern Dion*. If you bring this letter which has my stamp on it, he will greet you.
