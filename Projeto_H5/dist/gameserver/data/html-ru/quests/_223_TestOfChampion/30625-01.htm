!Mason:

I have lost my wife and children due to Grecia's attack. The people of Grecia's army are my lifelong enemies because they have deprived me of my most precious thing, my family. They are the Ol Mahums who are also called as the 'Bloody Axe'. I swear to God that I will revenge them some day.
