You may not be able to appreciate my weak body, but the experience and know-how which I have accumulated in the battlefields can't be ignored... These days, I am teaching young soldiers how to confront the flying corps or the strategy of arranging troops in times of siege warfare. I hope you keep up the good work. And protect the peace of this kingdom.
