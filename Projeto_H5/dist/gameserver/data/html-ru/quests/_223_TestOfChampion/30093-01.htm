I see that you are a follower of Ascalon. Seeing a strong warrior like you brings back memories. Like Ascalon, I was once a member of the Steel Rose Mercenaries. When I was young, I studied herbology and first aid in the temple and used these skills to become a medic for the troop. Of course, occasionally I also wielded a spear and joined the battle.

These days I am retired and run a small shop. Ascalon still comes around and asks me to make medicine and antidotes for the village guards from time to time.
