Ah! Thank you so very much. This is such a blessing, as I was badly needing help. Could you do me one more favor?  I must gather *antidote ingredients*.

I am concerned about the increase in the number of soldiers poisoned by Medusa's venom, but near destruction? That's a serious exaggeration.

In order to create the antidote, I will need 3 ingredients. They are *the Harpy's Egg, Medusa Venom, and Windsus' Bile*. There is no need to search afar for these ingredients, they are all quite common right here in Giran. I know that there is an abundance of harpies and windsus near the Corridor of Death.  Please gather *30 each* of the ingredients. Thank you.
