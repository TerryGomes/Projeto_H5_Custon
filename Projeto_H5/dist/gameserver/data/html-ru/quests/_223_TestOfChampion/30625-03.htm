Up until this day, I wished I could tear the remaining soldiers in Grecia's army in this territory to death. But I am afraid that I grew too weak to revenge them myself.

I will give you this ring that I wore in my army days. Please wear it and seek my revenge. Kill them all, kill the *Bloody Axe* who took away the lives of my dear family. Those Ol Mahums are staying in the *northern part of Oren*. You will be able to find their army post when you move farther north from the Corridor of Death of Kiran.

It won't be enough until you have at least cut down*100 heads* of Bloody Axe!
