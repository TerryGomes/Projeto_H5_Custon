!Veteran Ascalon:

Would you like to hear about my splendid past? When I was young I used to be hired as a soldier. Back in those days I wandered around freely and fought against the alien army and made love with foreign women. There were times when things seemed to be too harsh, but even then, my blazing spirits as a Warrior never burned low. The flaming friendship among comrades, struggles, fierce battles, love and romance, I experienced them all. We were true Warriors.

But I am too old now. If I find a talented young fellow who will succeed me, I would like to retire in peace. I can see that you are quite a strong Warrior, what do you think? Will you try to the *Test of the Champion*?
