<html><body>Captain Bathis:<br>
The favor I ask is on behalf of <font color="LEVEL">Magister Rohmer</font> of the Temple of Einhasad. The Sages of Magic, a group of magisters of which Magister Rohmer is a member, are researching the Kaneus: recently discovered monsters of Kamaloka.<br>
They know that Kamaloka exists between this world and the infernal regions; "normal" monsters in that region mutate into the Kaneus.<br>
They do not know the cause of this mutation, however.<br>
To assist their research into this matter, they asked me to obtain some <font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of the Kaneus.</font> Will you help me?<br>
<font color="LEVEL">(You may only undertake this quest only if you are eglible to enter Kamaloka, Hall of the Abyss, level 23.)</font><br>
<a action="bypass -h Quest _10276_MutatedKaneusGludio 30332-03.htm">Say yes.</a>
