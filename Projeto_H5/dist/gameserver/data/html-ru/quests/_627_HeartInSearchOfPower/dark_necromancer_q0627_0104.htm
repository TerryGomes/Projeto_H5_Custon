!Mysterious Necromancer:

All I know so far is that the remains of saint are in place called *Enfeux*, which is sealed.

I must make a seal from beads of obedience to unlock it. Beads of obedience control the thoughts of the creatures that guard the Valley of Saints. Bring me 300 of them. You can take them fom *Eyes of Splendor, Flashes of Splendor, Kinfe Edges of Splendor, Wisdom of Splendor, Souls of Splendor, Victories of Splendor, Vengeance of Splendor, Shouts of Splendor, Seals of Splendor, Crowns of Splendor and Wailing of Splendor.* I'm counting on you!
