!Mysterious Necromancer:

You aren't a pilgrim, are you? Anyway, you've traveled a long way, haven't you? Could you help me with something?

I'm trying to create a new type of chimera! I've tried all sorts of ingredients, including blood of vampire and muscle of Ogre!

I've come here to find a new source for ingredients... But gathering ingredients isn't as easy as it seems! Right now I'm trying to find remains of saint!

Why are you looking at me like that? You think we should just let them rot? Do you want to help me or what?
