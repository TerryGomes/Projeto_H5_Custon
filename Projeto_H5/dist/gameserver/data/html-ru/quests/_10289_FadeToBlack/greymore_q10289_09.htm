!Priest Greymore:

Good job. You proved yourself able to do more than just startle me on a consistent basis. The timing couldn't be better, I've grown weary of this Monastery and these idiotic mute monks. Perhaps Dominic will give me a position back in the Town of Rune.

Thanks again. Hopefully I will see you in Rune next time.
