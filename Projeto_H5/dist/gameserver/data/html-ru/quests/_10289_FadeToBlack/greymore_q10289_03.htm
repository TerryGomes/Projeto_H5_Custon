!Priest Greymore:

Alright. I've been here studying these confounding monks and their secrets, but so far I've been unable to find anything or any information of value. Bloody quiet lot, these. I suspect we must capture someone higher up the chain of command, as it were.

<font color="LEVEL">Master of Splendor Annays</font> is who I have in mind. Capture him and bring me his mark, what these monks call the <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Splendor</font>. Only he will have it, none of the others. They carry a <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Darkness</font>, and should you bring me back that, the only reward you will receive is my cackle. <font color="LEVEL">The Mark of Splendor is what earns the reward</font>
