!Priest Greymore:

Hmâ€¦ now that I think about it, might I tempt you with a mission from Dominic? It is not that I am incapable of doing it, but my face is too well known. Not like yours, at least not around here.

Besides, you're already here, and if Dominic saw fit to trust you with this parcel, I see no reason not to trust you myself.
