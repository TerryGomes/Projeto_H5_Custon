Oh my God! You have come this far for this...? Thank you.

How is my master? Things here are going so well..., too well that it makes me worried sometimes. The people here are much more open minded compared to other places.

We are planning a big assembly in the Elven relics of Talking Island, and we decided to hold a memorial service beforehand to calm down the magic creatures.

Ah, I see! Would it be possible for you to gather the bone pieces? Gather a piece of bone from every undead in the relic. Please take a look at this diagram...

This task is... gathering the bones for the memorial service so it has to be done by the Priests firsthand. Could you do that, please?
