!Preacher Sla:

I made a wise decision in sending you. It might have been too difficult for Katari to manage all alone... 

By the way, what is that? Is that Ol Mahum money? It's useless.

You'd better throw that away... As you know, I have one more thing that requires your help. There are some Ol Mahums who recently converted to my teachings, after being touched by my lecture on the tenet of light a few days ago. But the opposition from the church was so strong that I had to ask my pupils to shelter them in a safe place. We split them into 3 groups, and sent them to Talking Island, Orc Town of the northern region, and the Dwarven Village... But I haven't heard any news from them. I am very worried....with the recent Ol Mahum campsite incident and all... Would you go and check how they are doing for me?

I'll write you 3 letters to give to my disciples.. First, go and meet Kakan. She said that she would settle down in a place southeast of Orc Town...
