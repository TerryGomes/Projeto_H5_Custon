...Darn it! I would have never guessed, a betrayer...! Wait, there is no guarantee that the betrayer has come only to this place! I am worried about the other meeting places... I don't know what kind of person he is, but I can guess the way he is thinking...

Anyway, please take this letter to my master. He will give some sort of orders. Goodbye...
