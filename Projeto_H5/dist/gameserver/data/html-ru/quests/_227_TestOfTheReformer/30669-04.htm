Are you troubled that we are being deceitful? But we have already lost many friends because we have fallen for their lies. They do not know the meaning of a promise... And do you not think this is the best way to minimize sacrifices?

Here is a letter addressed to my master. Please deliver the letter any chance you get.

You say you must meet with all of Sla's disciples? Then try going to the village of the Dwarves, which is nearby. One of my fellow disciples, Nyakuri, has settled down in a place outside the Dwarven village, to the west.
