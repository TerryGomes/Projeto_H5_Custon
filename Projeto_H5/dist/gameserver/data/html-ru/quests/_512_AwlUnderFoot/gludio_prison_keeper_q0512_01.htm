!Prison Warden:

I am the warden of this castle prison. This monster dungeon was discovered only recently.

I suspect that other castles also have such dungeons. My duty is to keep this basement prison area safe.

Having monsters appear and disappear at will here would hardly let the castle inhabitants sleep soundly at night, eh?

Unfortunately, we don't have the numbers to handle this task alone.

We need help from the clan members.

We'll compensate you for your assistance, naturally.
