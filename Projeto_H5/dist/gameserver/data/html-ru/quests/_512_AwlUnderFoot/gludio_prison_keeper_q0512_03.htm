!Prison Warden:

Excellent! I appreciate your offer, friend.

This dungeon prison was only recently discovered, and no one knows its true purpose.

Some legends say that some emperor long, long ago created this dungeon as a place to secretly breed monsters for magical experiments.

Others say that it was build during the empire's golden age to contain monsters that were pitted against prisoners in gladiatorial fights.

Whatever its purpose, it was sealed and hidden for centuries -- we only recently uncovered the entrance.

Well, let's get down to brass tacks. Please defeat the leaders of *three prisoner gangs* that roam the dungeon, *Beautiful Atrielle, Nagen the Tomboy and Jax the Destroyer*, and bring me the monsters' rank badges.
