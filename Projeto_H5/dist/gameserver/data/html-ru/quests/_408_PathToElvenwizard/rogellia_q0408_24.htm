!Rosella:

Oh! You have collected all the jewels! Now we can begin the ritual.

Water is the source of life. Mother, and eternity. Cleanse our stained souls with the tears of Eva, purer than anything in the world, and give us your new blessing...

With this, you have performed the ritual and earned the qualifications to become an Elven Wizard. Here, take this *eternity diamond.* If you take this to *High Priest Raymond in Gludio Castle Town,* he will change your occupation to Elven Wizard. Of course, you can go to *High Priestess Levian in Gludin* as well.
