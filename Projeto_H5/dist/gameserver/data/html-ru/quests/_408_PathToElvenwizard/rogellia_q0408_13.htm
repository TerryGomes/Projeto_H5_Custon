How about learning a spell that increases memory? Haven't you already found the *pure aquamarine?* A young one like you should have a better memory!

As I told you before, the pure aquamarine symbolizes water. The Elves who serve Eva always have divine protection of water. That's why the aquamarine, which has the power of water, is the most beloved jewel among Elven Mystics.
