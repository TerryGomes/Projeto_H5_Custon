If you want the nobility amethyst, fetch *two regular amethysts* from the Underground Fortress. Defeat the *sukar wererat leaders* in the Underground Fortress to obtain the amethysts. There is an old superstition that the amethyst protects one's life. That is why I think those creatures always carry it around with them.
