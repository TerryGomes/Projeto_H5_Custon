Ruby... When I look at the red hues, I feel a memory stirring the passions of my youth... If you seek the ruby, symbol of fire, go to *Sorceress Greenis in the Elven Village*. I was her godmother when she was born. She is a fine lady. Please give her this letter I wrote about you so she will help you to find the ruby.
