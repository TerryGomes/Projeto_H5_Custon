!Magister Greenis:

Thank you. The Magical Powers Ruby contains a fiery force immensely valuable to those of us who study Elemental Magic.

I would like to create more of these rubies, but to do so I need a vital ingredient that can only be found on the neck of a Pincer Spider: *Red Down*.

If you bring me back 5 clumps of Red Down I will create a Magical Powers Ruby just for you. Here, take this. It is a talisman that has protected me from evil creatures in the past. Perhaps it will help you in this task as well.
