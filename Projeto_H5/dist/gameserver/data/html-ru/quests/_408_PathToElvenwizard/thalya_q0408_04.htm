!Thalia:

You have found all 5 gold leaves, I see. In return, I will tell you about the pure aquamarine.

The Mother Tree normally does not have any dew, but when the roots absorb the nutrition of the golden leaves, large, beautiful drops of dew form. On rare occasions, one can find a *pure aquamarine* among the dew. 

Here, take this pure aquamarine. I pray that you may safely pass your ritual. And do not forget... It is our responsibility to fill the forest and the plains with joyous music... When our songs fill the earth, the land will become a paradise.
