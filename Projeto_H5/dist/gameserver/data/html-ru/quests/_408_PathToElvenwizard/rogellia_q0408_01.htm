!Rosella:

Elven Wizards are in the preparatory level before becoming a Spellsinger or Elemental Summoner. They aren't to be compared with the likes of the Dark Elves, who walk the path of evil.

To become an Elven Wizard, you must learn how to communicate with the spirits. For this communication, you must find the four jewels that symbolize *water, fire, wind and earth* and then perform a ritual. The ritual is performed to gain understanding of the basic elements that construct the world, and to receive Eva's blessing.

Just recently, a young one of your age came and finished the ritual. What do you think? Will you take the challenge?
