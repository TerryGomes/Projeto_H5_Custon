!Thalia:

What have you come here for? Oh... What a delicious looking apple! Is this for me? This reminds me of the legend of the Elven maiden who picked the apple of knowledge.

Rosella sent you? Are you looking for the *Pure Aquamarine*? Rosella asked me before... She told me to kindly tell the whereabouts of the Aquamarine of Water, should anyone ask for it.

But aquamarines are not only precious, but a very valuable resource for us Elves. I cannot tell that secret to just anyone. If you perform a task for me, I shall tell you about the aquamarine.
