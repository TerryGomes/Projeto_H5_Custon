Give the book I gave you to Norwind. The book is called, 'Immortal Love'... A wonderful love story... So touching... He asked for the book a long time ago.

To find the Elven Fortress, first go north of the village to the Neutral Zone, cross the bridge, and enter the Elven forest. If you cross the bridge, you will immediately see the grand Elven Fortress. The entrance is at the other side of the mountain. You will be able to meet Norwind over there.
