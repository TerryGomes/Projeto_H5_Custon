Meet a person by the name of *Northwind* at the entrance to the Underground Fortress. He may know something abouth the amethyst. Give this book to him and he will give you aid. 

To find the Elven Fortress, first go north of the village to the Neutral Zone, cross the bridge, and enter the Elven forest. If you cross the bridge, you will immediately see the grand Elven Fortress. The entrance is at the other side of the mountain.
