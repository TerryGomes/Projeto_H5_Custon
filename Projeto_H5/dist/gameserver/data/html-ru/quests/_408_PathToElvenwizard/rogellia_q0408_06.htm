!Rosella:

Four things are required to perform the ritual. They are *4 jewels that represent water, fire, wind and the earth.* If you devote the jewels to Mother Nature and perform the ritual for Eva's blessing, in return, you will be able to communicate more deeply with the spirits.

First, I give you this *fertility peridot.* This is the token of earth, symbolizing abundance and productivity. This is given to you, who wants to have a deeper understanding of nature, as a gift. 

Now you must find the remaining three by yourself. Which one do you want to seek first?
