!Soul Guide Udan Mardui:

Oh, were you successful? Is this the Red Totem? I feel the strong energy of fire! I didn't think that Ketra Orcs could use this mysterious power!

In honor of your wisdom and courage, I hereby bestow upon you this holy relic of our tribe, the *Divine Stone of Wisdom*.

Now, I, Udan Mardui, will discover the secret contained within the totem. Come back to see me later. I'll have more work for you.
