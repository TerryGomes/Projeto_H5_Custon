!Warehouse Freightman Kluck:

Whew! There's no way I can keep up this pace! Hello, friend! Am I glad to see you!

For as long as anyone can remember, Dwarves have been traders, am I right? And now come the Humans, with their friends in high places, taking over the trade routes in Innadril, Abella, and Giran! Who do they think they are?

Boycott the Humans! We're establishing a free trade zone near Alligator Island! The only problem is, that place is crawling with horrible monsters.

Would you help us get rid of them? If you'd like, we can draw up a contract right now!
