!Bard Swan:

Oh, thank you so much! Actually, I have already ordered a flute for her from the *Trader Woodrow of Aden Castle Town*, a specialist in exotic musical instruments. Please check with him to see if the flute has arrived.

Mention my name and he will tell you the status of my order. Afterwards I will give you a musical score that is necessary to make an echo crystal.
