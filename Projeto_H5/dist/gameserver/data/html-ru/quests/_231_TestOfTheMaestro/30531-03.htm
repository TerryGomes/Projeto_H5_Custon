!First Elder Lockirin:

It has been a long time since a Dwarf has come to take the Maestro test. Youngsters these days do not appreciate the benefits of hard work... You are a notable exception, my ambitious young friend.

Actually,it is far too easy to become a Maestro these days. In the days of my youth the test was so intense that the stress would often cause physical disfigurement! Many ended up looking like Elves! These days you only need to get recommendations from the 3 Elders...

So would you like to take the test?
