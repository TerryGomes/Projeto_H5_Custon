!Elder Balanki:

Good deal! Well done! Those Orcs... I'm afraid to say I doubted that they would agree for a while, but here is their promise! Thank you so very much! I wish there were more Dwarves around like you! Here js the letter of recommendation that I promised. I shall make a place for you once I am First Elder. I hope we can work together again in the future...
