!Chief Croto:

Truthfully, we were exiled from the holy land and have been living in a foreign village. The bitterest pill to swallow is that the altar of our ancestors is in the hands of our betrayers.

I have tried and failed several times to retrieve the altar which is being kept in the Cave of Trial.

This year we sent the army and not one has returned. My nephew Kamuru is among the lost... Possibly lost in the cave or killed by the monster... Anyway, if something has happened to him I won't be able to face my sister.

Let us make a bargain. Go to the Cave of Trial and find out what has happened to Kamuru. If he was killed by monsters, bring his belongings to me.

If you will do this favor for me, I'll fulfill the request of that old Dwarf! Do you understand?
