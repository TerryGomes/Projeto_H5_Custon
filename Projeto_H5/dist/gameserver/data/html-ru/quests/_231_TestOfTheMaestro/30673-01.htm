!Researcher Loraine:

Let's talk about the research paper afterwards! One of the research team was poisoned by a monster in the dungeon! He managed to escape from the monster, but if he doesn't have his antidote quickly, he'll die soon! Fortunately, we can find all the materials for the antidote around here... But we are short of people!

You said you were an adventurer? We need 10 Needles of Weird Bees, 10 units of Leech's Blood, and 10 Cobwebs of Swamp Spider from the swamp area right now... Can you find these things, please? We'll talk about the research paper after we have saved my colleague.
