!High Priest Sylvain:

Many of our regional temples have recently reported certain signs and omens that we cannot ignore...

We dispatched an inspector to investigate, but apparently something befell his party near the Execution Grounds.

He was carrying the final report on his discoveries when, we suspect, he and his companions were attacked.


Defeat monsters at the Execution Grounds -- *Amber Basilisks, Strains, Ghouls, Granite Golems, Dead Seekers and Hangman Trees* -- and bring me the *pieces of the inspector's report*.

It should be approximately *30 pages* altogether...
