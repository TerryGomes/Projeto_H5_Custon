!High Priest Sylvain:

You are neither the Hands nor the Feet of the Temple of Einhasad....

I'm a bit uncomfortable entrusting you with an important mission for the Temple.

There is some classified information about the Temple involved here, you see... Please understand...

You may ask Priest Shegfield about becoming the Hands of the Temple, and you can speak with Priest Glyvka about becoming the Feet of the Temple...

(Only characters who have completed the Feet of the Temple and Hands of the Temple quests are permitted to take on this quest.)
