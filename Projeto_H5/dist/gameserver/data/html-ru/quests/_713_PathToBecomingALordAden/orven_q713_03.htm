!High Priest Orven:

One way is to protect our rich history. There are a great many historical sites that have fallen into disrepair and decay. The National Cemetery and the many devastated castles in our territory are perhaps the saddest examples.

You know, don't you, that a group of Taik Orcs have settled in the National Cemetery? What desecration! Defeat them and drive them out so we may reclaim an important part of our heritage. Then I'll support your bid for the lordship. I also ask that you send me 5 of your most capable followers. I have a mission for them as well.
