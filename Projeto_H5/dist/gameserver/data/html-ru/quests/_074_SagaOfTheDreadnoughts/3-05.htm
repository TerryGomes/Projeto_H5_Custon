!Grand Master Bernhard:

You're back! Did you bring the Divine Stone of Wisdom?%%
Good job! You are as capable as the bride of Antharas told me.%%
Now I'll give you the Stone of Commune. The stone tablet that forms a union with it is north of the Varka Silenos stronghold.%%
I'd like to see it myself, but I'm not a descendant of a dragon like you. The bride left a note with me.
