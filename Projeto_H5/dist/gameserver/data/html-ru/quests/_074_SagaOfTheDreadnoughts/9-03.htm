!Tablet of Vision:

A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A vision appears of a black knight!%%
There's a woman trying to prevent a man from getting the power of the dragon.%%
White wings and the overwhelming presence of power! This is similar to the fear of a soldier facing the Lord of War on the battlefield.%%
But the descendants of dragons have nothing to fear, like Leona.%%
The Tablet of Vision can be found in the southern part of the Forest of the Dead where Leona is!
