!Tablet of Vision:

As you approach the tablet, you hear a terrible racket, as if two giant powers had collided! You hear a woman scream.%%
This is all familiar to you. There's that huge angel, and the lady with the power of a dragon!%%
Warlords are many people's only hope and must have great strength. The blood of dragons boils in their veins. Dragons strike a blow...!%%
.....There's the tablet! Is it real or an illusion? The sound of swordplay brings you back to reality.
