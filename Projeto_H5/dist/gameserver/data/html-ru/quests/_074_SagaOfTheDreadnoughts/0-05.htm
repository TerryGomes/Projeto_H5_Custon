!Master Aiken:

Warlords studied the fighting techniques of dragons during the war of the gods. That's why we're rumored to be descended from dragons!%%
*Leona Blackbird*, also known as the* Bride of the Fire Dragon*, was once captain of the guards in Giran. Before the era of chaos began she was defeated by Sighardt Ein. Now she's a wanderer.%%
Her fighting technique was truly excellent. If you wish to improve yours, you should meet her.
