Dius the Messenger of Destruction is a huge Drake of the Sky. He scours the skies for Tiat, the lord of the Seed of Destruction.<br>
Fortunately, he is normally scarce. If you apply a special <font color="LEVEL">bait for Drakes</font> to <font color="LEVEL">Baby Drake Wings</font>, however, you can lure him out. I will mark the area where he appears on your map.
