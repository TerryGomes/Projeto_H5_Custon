<html><body>Mage Notingale:<br>
Rok, the King of Birds, used to be the largest and most intelligent bird in Gracia. But since the Seed of Destruction and Storm Dragon Lindvior appeared, he has been in hiding.<br>
As the power of the Seed of Destruction has waned, however, he appears to be regaining his former control over birds. When the power of the Seed of Destruction is weak, you may see Rok if you attack birds nearby. I will mark the areas on the map where he most often appears.
