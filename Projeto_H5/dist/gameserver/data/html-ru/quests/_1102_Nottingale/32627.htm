First of all, you must acquire either an Aurabird or an Airship in order to fight against the enemies who populate our skies. Since the number of Airships is limited, I recommend you acquire an Aurabird.<br>
To do so, go meet Engineer Lekon and do what he tells you. Even if you decide to acquire an Airship, Lekon is worth talking to.<br>
Check your map and I will tell you his location.
