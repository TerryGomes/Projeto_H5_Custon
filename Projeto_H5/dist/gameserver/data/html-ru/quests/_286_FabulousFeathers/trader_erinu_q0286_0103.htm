When you enter Nornil's Cave, you will encounter bird-like humanoid creatures called Muertos. Among them are *Captains, Warriors, Archers, Leaders and Wizards*, all of which can be distinguished by their powerful wings.

Some Humans will pay a premium for Muertos feathers to use as decorations for accessories and weapons.

*Collect at least 80 feathers* and bring them to me.
