!Trader Erinu:

I've heard that you are ready to enter Nornil's Cave.

That means that the time is also drawing near for you to leave this island. Well, they say that the mainland is also filled with adventure.

Before you leave, though, would you do me a small favor by retrieving something for me from Nornil's Cave?
