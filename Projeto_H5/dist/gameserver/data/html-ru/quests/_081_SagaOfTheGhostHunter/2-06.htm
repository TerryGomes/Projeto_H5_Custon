!Master Drakon:

These recipes are fabulous!%%
 I'll only tell the story of my ancestors once, so listen well.%%
The story says that the power was sealed by Einhasad, but unbeknownst to him, Gran Kain and Eva took a portion of it and sealed it into stone tablets that they then distributed throughout the world. The power of the tablets is obtained by communing with them using a Stone of Commune. By going through many trials, my ancestors collected that power!%%
Here's the remaining Stone of Commune that's been in my family for generations. You need this to get the power of Tablet.%%
The location of the first Tablet is in the south of Tower of Insolence. Go look for it.
