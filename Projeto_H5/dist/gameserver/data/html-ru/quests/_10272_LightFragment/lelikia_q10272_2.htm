!Priest of Shilen Lelikia

Listen what I say and tell this to War Mage:

*The power of darkness infuses the storm*%%
*And storm of the darkness can vitaly hurt*%%
*But darkness will strike only one who has light*%%
*So bring piece of darkness to Einhazad's sight.*

Now you should leave. Have you remembered what I said?
