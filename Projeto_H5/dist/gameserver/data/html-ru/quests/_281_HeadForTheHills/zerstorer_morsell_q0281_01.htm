!Zerstorer Marcela:

Since our island was opened to the outside world, we have seen a dramatic increase in the number of goods and people landing at our port.

In fact, the road connecting it to our village has now become one of the island's major thoroughfares.

Unfortunately, all the traffic has also attracted monsters from the Hills of Gold; the creatures are coming down to attack caravans and feast on unwary travelers.

We do not have the manpower to dispatch an armed force to clear the Hills of Gold, but I have been authorized to hire adventurers to help deal with the situation.

Interested?
