!Magister Justin:

Thanks for the report. This merits further investigation.%%
To become an Archmage, you'll need a Stone of Commune for each of the six stone tablets. Use the stones to commune with the tablets and your path will become clear.%%
Here's the first Stone of Commune, take it to the Tablet of Vision.
