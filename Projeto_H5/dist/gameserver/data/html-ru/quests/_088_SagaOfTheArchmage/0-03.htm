To put it simply, you can't just read the text on the Tablet of Vision, you must have a* Stone of Commune*. It gives you a direct transmission of the knowledge if you* commune with the tablet*. This stone is quite rare, but has been sighted recently. Ask* Magister Justin of Goddard Castle Town* about what to do from here. Here, take a guild newsletter with you.
