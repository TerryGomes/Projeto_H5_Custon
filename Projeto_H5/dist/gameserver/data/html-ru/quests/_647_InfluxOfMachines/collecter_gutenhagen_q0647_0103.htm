Collector Gutenhagen:

The job is to take care of these Golems.

Yumi's been doing it alone, but she needs help, someone she can rely on.

Any Golems belonging to the Horrifying Golem Army are fine.

You will be dealing with Guard Golems inside the building or Terror Golems in the Strip Mines. When you collect *500 fragments* from them I'll trade you for some items out of the Collector Guild.

Good luck golem smasher!
