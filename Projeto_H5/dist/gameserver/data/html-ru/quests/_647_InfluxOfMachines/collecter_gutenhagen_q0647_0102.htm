Collector Gutenhagen:

When I first came here, these barracks were full of Dwarves... Now they're deserted!

That is, of course, except for Yumi and me!

Yumi's on some sort or research mission, and I can't just leave her alone!

You don't look like a strong-enough fellow... Come back later if you looking for work.
