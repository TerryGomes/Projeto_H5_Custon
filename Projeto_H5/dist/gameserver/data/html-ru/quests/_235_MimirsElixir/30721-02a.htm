Great! I am glad to see you are full of ambition! In order to start, you will need to create a magic potion which is known as "Mimir's Elixir". In order to create this, you will first have to learn how to mix reagents in the cauldron.  Then, you will need to find some ingredients.

The first ingrendient is *Pure Silver*. To create it, you will need equal parts of lunargent and quicksilver.  Also, you will need to set a temperature for the fire. Make sure you choose the lowest fire. That is, set the temperature to 1.

Go and talk to *Magic Trader Wesley*. He will teach you what you need to know to create pure silver. Come back to me after you have aquired one.
