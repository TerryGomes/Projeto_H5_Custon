Is that Pure Silver?! Nicely done! I expected as much from someone with your skills. Now, you need to find a second ingredient, one we call *True Gold*.

A long time ago, I has some True Gold myself! One of my colleagues really needed it for an experiment, so I gave it to her. Go and talk to *Magister Joan*. Tell her I sent you. She should have some True Gold for you.
