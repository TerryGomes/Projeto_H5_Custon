Congratulations on creating Mimir's Elixir. Are you ready then? Go ahead and drink the potion...I know it's a bit thick and tasteless, but bear with it. Aren't you feeling its effects already? Your body rejuvinating, your mind expanding...getting the capacity to learn that children have, yet keeping all the knowledge you earned in your adult life!

Alright then! You are ready! A new life is awaiting. Go to a town and talk to the head of the teachers for the new occupation you wish to learn.

Before you go, I have one more thing for you. Recently, I found this scroll for enchanting A grade weapons. I have no use for it, but to an adventurer like yourself it's precious. So you can have it.
