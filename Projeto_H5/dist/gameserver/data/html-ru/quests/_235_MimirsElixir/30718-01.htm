!Magister Joan:

Are you the person Ladd sent for True Gold? I was already informed you were coming. To tell you the truth, I do not really need it any more, but seing how much you need it, how about a trade?

For my next experiment, I need the Stone of Wisdom. Some also call it Sage's Stone. It can only be acquired by killing *Chimera Piece*. You can find this monster in the Field of Silence, near Giant's Cave. If you bring me this stone, I will give you some True Gold. So, what do you think?
