!Tablet of Vision:

A sharp blast of knowlege courses through your cranium! A vision appears of a black knight!%%
And there is your old comrade Panacea! What is that substance holding him?! Chains that have bound him!%%
You sense a power that rejects change because of a desire for rest...%%
You sense that weariness coming over you. The next Stone of Commune is in the northern Forsaken Plains!
