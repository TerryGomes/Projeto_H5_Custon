This is the material that I use for my study. Because the power of Goddess Eva and other powers are swriling in the stone...%%
And another reason is that this Stone of Commune is not impossible to get. Those who have this Stone of Commune are* Demon Halisha's Inferiors*. If you enter the Imperial Tomb, or fight in the Shrine of the Loyal near the Wall of Argos, you will be able to meet the Archon or Inferiors of Halisha. You can get this stone if you defeat them.%%
Do you understand? If you want this stone, you need to defeat* Halisha's Inferiors or Archon*. The Stone of Commune will let you know where the fifth tablet is.
