!Maria:

I was right about you! You have a deep sense of what is right and wrong. We think you'll be a great help to us!

Floran Village is autonomous, and has no protection against organized military attacks. But they've recently formed a militia to protect the village from the monsters... Go to *Floran Village* and meet Militia *Captain Alex*...

Tell him I sent you! Good luck!
