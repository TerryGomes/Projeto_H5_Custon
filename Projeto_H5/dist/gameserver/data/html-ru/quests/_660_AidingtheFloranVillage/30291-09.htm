Ah, Maria. Poor, poor girl. If ever a bride meant her vow I' "for better or for worse it was she. Maria married JasonP at the height of our monster troubles, but you wouldn't have known anything was wrong to see the two of them so happy, so in love. It did us all good to see them.
Jason worked his fields as hard as any man could, but they didn't yield enough to support them, and Maria was soon great with child. He did what many men would in his place: he took a chance. He found some wild, abandoned fields with fertile soil, and he began to work them. He didn't recognize the signs of monsters in the area; he was a farmer, not a tracker or an adventurer. One day, he didn't return from his new field, and we haven't seem him since.

It makes my blood boil to think of it. We all failed him. We of the militia didn't protect him. We should have! If only we could have! What good are we if we can't even keep our farmers safe against monsters? They can't fight fields with fertile soil, and he began to work them. He didn't recognize the signs of monsters in the area; he was a farmer, not a tracker or an adventurer. One day, he didn't return from his new field, and we haven't seem him since.

Hrmph. Forgive me. Hadn't meant to go on so. Anyway, Maria is bereft. She wants 200 dead monsters to put Jason's soul to rest. I wish I could give 'em to her; she
I' could use some peace. But where could I get 200 dead
monsters?
