!Captain Alex:

Maria sent you, you say? Hrmph. Unfortunate business, that, Is she doing better?

In any event, I'm glad to see you. We're having a problem with monster incursions, and the militia's spread too thin to handle it. Most of the attacks have been on farmers trying to reclaim and cultivate nearby abandoned land.

I'll wager you're just the type of adventurer we need to fight this problem, and there's a reward in it. Just bring me the *Watching Eyes*, a *Golem Shard* and a *Delu Lizardman Scale* to prove your kills. 

Good hunting!
