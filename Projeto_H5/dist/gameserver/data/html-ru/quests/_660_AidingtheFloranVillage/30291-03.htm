!Captain Alex:

Great rumbling thunder, you've done some work here that's for sure! You have this soldier's thanks. Now we can get those fields working, and that means more food for everyone. Well, I can't offer you much, but please take this adena as compensation for the great good you've done us.

It's obvious you are a person of action, and to be honest, we have more problems that could use your attention. You've proven your mettle to all of us, so... are you interested?
