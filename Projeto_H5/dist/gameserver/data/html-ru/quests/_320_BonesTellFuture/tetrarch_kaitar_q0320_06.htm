!Tetrarch Kaitar:

You have collected all *10 bone pieces*. Well done! Within these bone pieces that you have collected are the final breaths of the brothers that were sacrificed at the hands of the enemy 100 years ago. Can you feel it? The beautiful smell of death?

Here is the compensation that I promised. Now, may the peace of the darkness and the shelter of the abyss be with you.
