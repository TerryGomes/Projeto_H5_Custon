!Tetrarch Kaitar:

For the past 300 years, I have lived to fulfill the will of Gran Kain and Shilen. As a reward for my devotion, goddess Shilen gave me the ability to see into the future.

Once a month, I perform spells to foresee the dangers or disasters that will affect my race and forecast the direction in which the Temple of Darkness must proceed. However, the spells are not that simple. The preparation process is complicated and I need many different materials. Sooner or later, I will tell you to collect the materials I need for the spells, so be prepared.

(Quest for Dark Elven characters level 10 or above.)
