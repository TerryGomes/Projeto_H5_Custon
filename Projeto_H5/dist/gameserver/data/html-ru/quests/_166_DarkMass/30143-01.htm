!Master Trudy:

So Undrias has sent you. Please give this *scripture* to him. It was discovered in an abandoned mine by sentry warriors sent to the Misty Mountains to fight the orcs. Surprisingly, it is a scripture written by ancient Humans who served Gran Kain. Isn't that interesting?

Undrias says that he plans to recite a portion of this scripture during this year's mass of darkness. Be sure to deliver this scripture to him.
