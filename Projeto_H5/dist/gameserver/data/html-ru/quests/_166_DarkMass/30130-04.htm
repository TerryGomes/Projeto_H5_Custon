!Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:

Take this letter and bring me the items from the village. You must seek out three people -- *Iria* of the *weapons shop*, *Dorankus* of the *warehouse*, and *Master Trudy* of the *House of Elders*. Bring the *ceremonial dagger* used during the ceremony from *Trader Iria*, the *wine* that I entrusted a few years ago from *Warehouse Keeper Dorankus*, and *Garmiel's Scripture* from *Master Trudy*.

I'm sure it's not a difficult task, going around and collecting supplies? I will not tolerate mistakes. Don't worry, I'll reward you as soon as the job is completed.
