!Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:

I see -- Kekropus simply told you the history and left it to me to tell you the meaning of your existence...

Very well, then. First of all, what do you think Inspectors and Judicators are? Remember how you became an Inspector.

The composition of our race's bodies restricts Kamael males and females to different paths. In order for you to become an Inspector, you must be a child of the Kamael who is also born with *Seeds of Chaos* -- a very rare occurrence.

Alternately, you must have the Seeds of Chaos in your hand. Do you?
