!Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:

Kamael Warriors. Perfect soldiers! But even the sharpest sword is useless without a skilled wielder.

I know Kekropus has said, in the hopes that our power will not be abused, that the blade is enough for us -- but a sword is of no use unless someone draws it. We need more than simply *a leader who keeps the blade sharp for some undetermined future* -- we need one unafraid to lead us into that future.

Only through decisive action can we finally become the blade of chaos our creators intended us to be, and achieve our true destiny.
