!Hierarch Kekropus:

Before the advent of the 3 Heroes, we were created with certain unrealized spiritual potential, but no particular physical or martial abilities. Our creators, the Giants, had little need of protection from ordinary physical threats -- we were an interesting experiment they conducted, little more.

We did, however, possess a special ability to use the soul as a medium. This is due to the fact that we were created using Mimir's Spring Water and as a result were closer to souls than other beings, not because the Giants intentionally bestowed that skill on us.
