!Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:

You may wish to refuse, but it may not be possible. A shackle of the creator still remains in you and may unconsciously limit your advancement.

But you cannot allow others to make the decision for you.

Don't you see? All you have seen, all you have experienced, show that we are heading for the final conflict and destruction.

But take heart! Execute the laws you believe should be executed. That will become one of the factors of chaos -- a variable that may yet influence that final battle.

In your soul, you are already a Judicator...
