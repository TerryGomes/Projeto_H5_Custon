!Vice Hierarch Eindburgh:

The Seeds of Chaos were planted by the King of Chaos to enable their recipients to overcome the restrictions imposed on mortals by the gods.

This is why the wielders of Enuma Elish can still live, despite being cursed by the gods.

If this power is manifested, we Kamael can finally free ourselves from our fate as warriors who live only for battle. One who walks this other path is the Inspector.

It is a possibility that even our creators couldn't imagine.
