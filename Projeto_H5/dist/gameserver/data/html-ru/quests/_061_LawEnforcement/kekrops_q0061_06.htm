!Hierarch Kekropus:

Because our natural powers were so weak, we were forced to develop other skills. Over time, and in order to inherit the abilities of the 3 Heroes, we learned the skill of manipulating souls. In doing so, however, we were confronted with a new question: why did we in fact possess this skill when the 3 Heroes did not?
