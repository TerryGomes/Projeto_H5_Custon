!Hierarch Kekropus:

As I just said, he was a genius produced by time and chaos. He was not a Spicula like myself or the 3 Heroes, but a Metucela Kamael like you...

No one knows what became of him. Certainly a Metucela Kamael's life span is long by the standards of other races, but even he must be long dead by now.
