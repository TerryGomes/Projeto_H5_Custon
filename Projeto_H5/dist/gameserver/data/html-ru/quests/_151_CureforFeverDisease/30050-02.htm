!Elias:

I am Elias, one of the teachers from the Einhovant's School of Wizardry. My students and I went to the forest to the north of the island on a field trip recently, but some of my students have fallen ill with a *strange fever*. It has been more than a week since they became ill, but we have yet to find a treatment. I am going crazy with worry that my students may die.

Thankfully, the Priest Yohanes has created a medicine, but he is running short on ingredients. Will you not go and gather the *necessary ingredients* for my dying students? Your aid is urgently needed. We need the *poison sac of the giant spider*, and I am asking you because I trust that someone of your abilities can easily manage this task.
