!Elias:

You haven't left yet? Hurry and fetch the poison sacs. My students are dying, and it pains my heart to see those youngsters in feverish hallucinations.

Go to the northern end of Talking Island to hunt the *giant spiders* and obtain their poison sacs. Take the poison sacs to Priest Yohanes, and he will make a fever medicine for you. Bring the medicine back to me. I beg you to help, my dear friend!
