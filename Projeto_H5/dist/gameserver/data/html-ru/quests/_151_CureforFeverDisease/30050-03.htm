!Elias:

I can't thank you enough for your help. The *giant spiders* abound in the northern parts of the island, so hunt them and bring back their poison sacs.

Once you have obtained the poison sacs, go to *Priest Yohanes*. He will create a fever medicine from the poison sacs. Bring the medicine back to me.

If one of my students should die, how will I ever face their parents? I just want to run far, far away. I implore you, please find those poison sacs. My students are dying!
