!Elias:

I'm Elias, one of the teachers from the Einhovant School of Wizardry. My students and I went to the forest to the north of the island on a field trip recently, but some of my students have fallen ill with a *strange fever*. It has been more than a week since they became ill, but we have yet to find a treatment. I am going crazy with worry that my students may die.

Thankfully, the Priest Yohanes is researching methods to create a *medicine* for them. He is very learned in herb lore, and has treated many illnesses. I trust that he will soon find a way to create a medicine for them. But I worry that because there are so many students that need to be treated, he may not have enough ingredients. If we are short on ingredients, I will ask for your aid, so please help us if it is necessary.
