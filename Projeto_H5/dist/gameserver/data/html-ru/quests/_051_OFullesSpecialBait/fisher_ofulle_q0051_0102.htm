!Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:

A while back, I ordered some special seeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather.
The flowers of the plants are used to make a very special bait!
They're called ice snow flowers because they bloom in the dead of winter. 
All of my order was stolen by bandits, and with the chaos left after the war, 
I haven't been able to order any more! But I'm just a poor fisherman, 
and no better equipped to deal with them than you are!
