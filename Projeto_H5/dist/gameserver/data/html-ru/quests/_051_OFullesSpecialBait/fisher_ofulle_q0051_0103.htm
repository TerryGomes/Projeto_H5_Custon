!Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:

A while back, I ordered some special seeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather.
The flowers of the plants are used to make a very special bait!
They're called ice snow flowers because they bloom in the dead of winter. 
My entire order was stolen by fettered souls! In the chaos left after the war, 
I haven't been able to order any more. 
I'm just an ordinary fisherman, and no better equipped to handle those ruffians than you are!
