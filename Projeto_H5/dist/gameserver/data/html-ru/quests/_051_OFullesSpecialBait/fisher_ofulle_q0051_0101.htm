!Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:

I may look chipper, but I feel terrible!  Recently a delivery of ingredients for our bait of chill was hijacked by *fettered souls* at the *Death Pass*! 
It was several years worth of supplies! A devastating loss!

Are you here for bait? Sorry, I couldn't make any if I wanted to. What can I do?
