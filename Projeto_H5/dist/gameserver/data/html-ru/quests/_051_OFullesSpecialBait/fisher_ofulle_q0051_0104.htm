!Fishermen's Guild Member O'Fulle:

A while back, I ordered some special seeds from Goddard that are designed for cold weather. 
The flowers of the plants are used to make bait of chill. My entire order was stolen by fettered souls! 
In the chaos left after the war, I haven't been able to order any more. 
I'm just a poor fisherman, and not equipped to deal with those ruffians! 
Would you help me? Bring me *100 of the lost bait materials* from the *fettered souls* at the *Death Pass*. 
I'll make *bait of chill* for you.
