Collector Yumi:

And then came the explosion. I think the Bronze Key Guild was getting too close to finding Dr. Chaos. We were investigating ways to enter the lab building, and it would have been only a matter of time before we found him. So he set off the explosion just as we were about to gain entry, and it was madness. The Guardians awoke, and countless golems suddenly appeared and overran us.
