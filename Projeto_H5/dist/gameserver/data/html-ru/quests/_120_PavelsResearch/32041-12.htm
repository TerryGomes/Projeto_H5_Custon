Collector Yumi:

The Guardian Golem was a huge and powerful being. Our Warsmiths fought valiantly against it, but we were finally forced to retreat.

By the time we regrouped and returned, all the working golems were already under Dr. Chaos' control. We again had to retreat.

I have remained here ever since in order to find a band of adventurers such as yourselves, hoping to find out exactly how Dr. Chaos accomplished all this  and, more importantly, what we can do to stop him.

We have learned much from Wendy and Atlanta, but perhaps not yet all. Go and seek out Wendy once more. Find out all you can about Dr. Chaos' past and present actions  and put a stop to his evil once and for all.
