Wendy:

All I know is that Dr. Chaos operated some kind of device. According to my memory, the device was meant *to control the weather* around Pavel. When the sleeping system awoke, its first act was to activate this device. I think perhaps the last mode in which it operated was *N-45: Arrival of Eternal Spring.*
