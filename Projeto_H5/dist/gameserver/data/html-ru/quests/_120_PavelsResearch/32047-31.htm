Do not concern yourselves about the Horrifying Golem Army. They cannot leave this place. Atlanta is gone now, so there is nothing and nobody to send electric waves to them. They cannot even receive Dr. Chaos' commands; they are merely broken machines, capable only of simple aggression. Now I think the Dwarves can start their work without any difficulty.
