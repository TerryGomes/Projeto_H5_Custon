Atlanta:

Oh, little one! You've done it! The crisis in the north wing has been averted! But I"m afraid we still have some serious problems in the east and west wings! Go to the east wing... it's the administration wing... You must find out...  Speak with Wendy, little one! Find out what's going on in the east wing... She's bound to know... My wonderful Wendy... awoke there...  She should know the password!
