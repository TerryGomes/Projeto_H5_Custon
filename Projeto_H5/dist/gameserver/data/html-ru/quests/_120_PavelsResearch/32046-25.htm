Atlanta:

It's likely to be protected by some sort of Golems. The last time I was there, there were several traps set, as well... At one time, I could have endowed the Aura of Awareness to allow you to pass the traps safely... But I'm far too weak now. You must be very careful! Perhaps the Weathermaster could give you the Aura of Awareness...  But I'm not sure about that at all! *I have a strong sense that there are fewer defenses at the south entrance to the north wing*.
