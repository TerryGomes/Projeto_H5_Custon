Collector Yumi:

Oh, my. There is more to this matter than I had suspected. How fortunate that I found adventurers with your experience to investigate this! Had I been lucky enough to make it as far as the Weathermaster, I would have stood there dumbfounded, I fear.

I see you have a book - is it the one? Please let me see it.
