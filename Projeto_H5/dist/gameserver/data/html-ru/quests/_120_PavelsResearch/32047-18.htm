Wendy:

The east wing? Oh, yes. You are probably are talking about the place where I was born. Dr. Chaos had his offices in the east wing. The last guardian was also resurrected there. My memory of that time is not clear, but Dr. Chaos' records are still on the bookshelf next to his lab. The record in question is a book with a lock on it. I cannot open it, but the Dwarves in the north may know how. *Please be careful. There might be a trap on the shelf.*
