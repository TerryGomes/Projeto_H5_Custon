Wendy:

I have no more to say to you. Please tell the Dwarf what I said. There is no more danger here; you have resolved all of the problems. I am being operated by a Starstone, but once that Starstone disappears, I will begin to be deactivated. I am looking forward to it Â— I want to rest, at long last. Please take this. It is all I have left to give.
