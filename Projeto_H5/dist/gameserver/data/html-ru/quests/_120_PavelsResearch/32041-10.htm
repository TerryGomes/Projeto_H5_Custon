Collector Yumi:

Yes, it was, in fact. However, it wasn't the focus of our efforts. Most of the Dwarves were interested in the strip mines. Only a few members of the Bronze Key Guild were investigating the research lab. The rest of us were working in support of the Gray Pillar Guild, who needed us to collect energy for golems, miscellaneous parts, materials, and the like. So our investigation of the lab was quite slow and sporadic. Dr. Chaos could have been hiding there and we would never have known it.
