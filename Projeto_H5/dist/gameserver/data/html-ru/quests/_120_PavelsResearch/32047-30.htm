Wendy:

Listen closely, for this pertains to Dr. Chaos.*From time to time, he comes here.* *If you attempt to speak with him, though, he will treat you as an enemy and dispatch a Gigantic Chaos Golem to rend the flesh from your bones.* If you can defeat him here, it will certainly keep him from causing any trouble for a while. As Atlanta said, it should not be a difficult task Â— provided that excellent adventurers such as yourselves are able to work together.
