Please, check out the Weathermaster in the north wing of the building! The password is *"ATL"* Basically, the password is my code name. Find out what's going on there. I'm afraid that the prototype of the project for the Arrival of Eternal Spring has been activated! If I'm right, you must put a stop to it immediately!
