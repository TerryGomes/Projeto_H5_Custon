Collector Yumi:

Is that so? Then the danger is almost ended. We have only to contend with a few thousand violent golems and a powerful mad scientist, ha ha!

I shouldn't complain, I suppose, but it seems that we have so many troubles that even eliminating as many as you have is not as much of a comfort as it should be. They are certainly beyond the competence of the Bronze Key Guild to solve. Also, if you'll pardon my mentioning it, I wish you hadn't lost the keys from the ancient ruin.
