Collector Yumi:

Oh, my heavens. This is a brooch from the Giant Age! And this one is especially made for Elves... no, I'm wrong, for Dwarves! The implications...

It must have been made during the Middle Age of Titans...

Please, may I buy this from you? There's not much of a market for it anywhere else, but to me it would be a treasure, and I will pay well for it. With this in my possession, the chief of the Bronze Key Guild must heed my report! What say you?
