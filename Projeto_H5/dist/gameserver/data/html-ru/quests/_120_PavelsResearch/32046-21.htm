Atlanta:

Well, at the very least, there will be an explosion in the north wing! At the worst, the same thing could happen again that happened the last time... when then project, "Arrival of the Eternal Spring" was thwarted... So, if the Flames of Pa'agrio were to explode again... Eternal Winter will consume these ruins once more!
