!Seer Livina:

That is not enough to soothe our ancestors' anger! Only when the blood of* fifty goblin grave robbers* wets the ground and their heads are offered on the altar, will the angry spirits of our ancestors go back to sleep in peace.

Young Orc, who fights for our pride, teach them the consequences of upsetting us!
