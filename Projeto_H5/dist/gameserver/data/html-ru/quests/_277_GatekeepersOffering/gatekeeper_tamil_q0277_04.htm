!Gatekeeper Tamil:

That is not enough at all. *I need at least twenty starstones.* If I can't offer them to the totem spirit of the spider, the door of space and time that connects our village to the mainland will be closed! So please hurry.

Defeat the *graystone golems* on the Immortal Plateau to obtain starstones. Be careful! They may be slow, but they are very strong and are hardly a force to be taken lightly. I will pray for your safe return!
