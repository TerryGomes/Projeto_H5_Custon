!Gatekeeper Tamil:

Thank you! I will not forget your kindness. But are you sure you know what is required? Every golem carries a *starstone* in its body. According to the Seers, the power of the stars contained within the starstone is the force that keeps the golems alive and moving.

Anyway, if you defeat *the graystone golems* on the Immortal Plateau, you will be able to collect the precious mineral that I need. I need *twenty* of those.

Be careful! The graystone golem may be slow, but its strength is great. You are placing yourself in great danger, so proceed with caution!
