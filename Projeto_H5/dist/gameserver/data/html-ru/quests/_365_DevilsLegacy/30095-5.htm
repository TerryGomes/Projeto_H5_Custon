!Warehouse Keeper Randolf:

Good job! You shall have your reward.

I hope you don't feel that you've been cheated. Not all the chests hold treasure, but the key required to open them is very expensive. Not to mention the magical scroll I must buy to protect against the horrible pirate curse that these chests sometimes impart. Truly, I take a terrible risk each time I open one. This is not a highly profitable business.

You should be happy to get your reward regardless of whether or not the chests hold treasure. I hope we can continue to do business together. Don't be fooled by *Collob*. He will probably offer to open the chests for you. His lack of experience could lead to terrible consequences...
