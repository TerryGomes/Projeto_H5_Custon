!Spellbook Seller Rouke:

You can obtain the *Giants' Experimental Tools Fragments* by defeating the *Marsh Stakatos, Stinger Wasps, Marsh Stakato Workers, Toad Lords, Marsh Stakato Soldiers, Marsh Spiders and Marsh Stakato Drones* in the *Cruma Marshlands*.

If you bring me *10 Giants' Experimental Tool Fragments*, I will re-assemble them into the *Giants' Experimental Tool*.

If you then fight the monsters while wearing this, the traitors who are attracted to the device will appear.

Defeat them and bring me *3 research papers concerning the Giants' technology*...

The Giants' Experimental Tools are easily broken, so you had better be sure to carry a sufficient number of them.
