!Priestess Glyvka:

Patience...

The monsters who inhabit the Cruma Marshlands were also the twisted creations of the Giants' so-called science.

Abandoned and isolated, there must be a large number of them by now. These creatures by their very existence are violations of the order established by Einhasad. They must be destroyed!

We also know of traitors who wish to acquire the secret knowledge of the Giants for themselves and use it against the servants of order.<br>Your mission is to vanquish both the monsters bred from the chaos of the Cruma Marshlands and the traitors who have been seduced by the Giants' ancient heresy.
