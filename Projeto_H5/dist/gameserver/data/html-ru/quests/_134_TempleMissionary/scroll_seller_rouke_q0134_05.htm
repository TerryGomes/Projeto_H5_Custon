!Spellbook Seller Rouke:

Excellent, you've gathered the *Giants' Experimental Tool Fragments* I need. Now take this fully operational *Giant's Experimental Tool*.

If you fight the monsters while this tool is in your inventory, the traitors will appear, as they are drawn to the tool.

Defeat them and bring me *3 research papers concerning the Giants' technology*...

The Giants' Experimental Tools are easily broken, so you had better be sure to carry a sufficient number of them.
