!Spellbook Seller Rouke:

You can obtain the *pieces from the Giant's Experimental Tools* by defeating the *Marsh Stakatos, Stinger Wasps, Marsh Stakato Workers, Toad Lords, Marsh Stakato Soldiers, Marsh Spiders and Marsh Stakato Drones* in the *Cruma Marshlands*.

If you bring me *10 Giant's Experimental Tool Fragments*, I will re-assemble them into the *Giant's Experimental Tool*.

If you then fight the monsters while wearing this, the traitors who are attracted to the device will appear.

Defeat them and bring me *3 research papers concerning the Giants' technology*. Then you will have done your duty.
