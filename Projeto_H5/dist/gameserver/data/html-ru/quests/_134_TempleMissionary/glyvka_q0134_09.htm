!Priestess Glyvka:

We serve Einhasad, the goddess of light, order and power.

Eons ago, Einhasad imprisoned Shilen, the evil goddess of death. She also destroyed the Giants, who in their arrogance and corruption sought to dethrone the gods themselves.

The people of this continent long served Einhasad in faithfulness and righteousness.

Recently, however, we have encountered signs that Shilen's influence is again growing: groups of disciples devoted to preparing her return, and hordes of monsters that have invaded the peaceful regions of our land.<br>In this age of rival warlords and ambitious adventurers, the chaos necessary for evil to prevail is all too prevalent.

It is our task to use all our resources to preserve order and carry out Einhasad's will.
