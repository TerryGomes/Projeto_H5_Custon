!Priestess Glyvka:

Then accept this badge, which shows that you are the feet of our Temple. Other citizens should learn from your example...

If you also become *the hands of the association, you will be awarded the title of the limbs of the association*...

To become *the hands of the Temple, seek out Priest Shegfield*.

You can be made the *limbs of the Temple by High Priest Sylvain*...

If you aspire to that level, you will have a place in our council and will be involved in important decisions.

Congratulations on your achievement as the feet of our association. I know you will well repay our trust...
