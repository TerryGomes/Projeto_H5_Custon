!Master Auron:

Now I'm a master who teaches young Fighters, but I was once a soldier for the *Warrior League*, walking the borderline between of life and death on the battlefield.

To be accepted into the *Warrior League*, there's no need for a noble birth or the lord's recommendation. We accept any Fighter who has courage and spirit.
