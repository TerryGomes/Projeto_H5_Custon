!Master Auron:

Good, so you have found the sword of trial. Here's what you must do now ... If you go out to the wilderness, you will find poison spiders -- their bodies are bigger than wagons, and they're violent and dangerous to deal with. Use only the rusty *bronze sword* to hunt the *poison spiders*. You may not use any other weapons.

When you kill a poison spider, cut off its legs and keep  them. Ah yes, and you may also bring the legs of the *trimden*, a spider which is a little more ferocious even than the poison spider. Collect *twenty spider legs* and bring them here. That is the test to become a *Warrior*. If you pass this test, I will give you the medallion of the *Warrior*.
