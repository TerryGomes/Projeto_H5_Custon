!Master Auron:

How do you hunt a *poison spider* with a *rusty sword*? Look here, fellow, do you know what the creed of our warriors guild is? It's stay alive even in the worst conditions*. There is no law that says you will always be at an advantage in a fight against your opponent. However, in any situation, you can win if you keep your wits about you.

Think of this ... do you think a knight armed with *luxurious steel armor* and a *steel sword* has achieved a real victory after killing a farmer who is armed with a *wooden spear*? True victory is rolling in the mud and taking a beating, then picking up a stone and striking for your opponent's head. It is that gruesome. Do you understand what I'm saying?
