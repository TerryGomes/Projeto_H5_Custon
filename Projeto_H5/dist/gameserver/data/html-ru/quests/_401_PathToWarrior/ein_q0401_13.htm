!Master Auron:

Have you returned? Well, I knew you would be able to do the job magnificently. I hereby give you the *medallion* of the *Warrior*. It is proof that you have earned the qualifications to change profession to a *Warrior*. Take it and go to *Grand Master Ramos* of our guild. He will change your profession to a *Warrior*. He is the one right over there.

I don't know how your future will turn out, but I hope you do not forget the warrior's creed that I've taught you. Until we meet again, may the goddess of victory smile on you!
