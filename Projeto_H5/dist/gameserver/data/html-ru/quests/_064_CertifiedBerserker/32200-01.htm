!Master Entien:

You came here after receiving my message? You came to the right place! As you know, some of the thieves who attacked our wagon have scattered to notify their superiors of the cargo`s destination. You must prevent them from doing so!

According to the report I recieved from a guild member, the thieves hzve disguised themselves as monsters and scattered in all directions. I eill track those who went south and west; you must find thjse thieves who went east and north.The thief who went east is disguised sa a Dead Seeker of Execution Grounds, while the one who went norht is disguised as a Marsh Atakato Drone from the Cruma Marshands. Find them, slay them andreturn to me!
