!Master Tenain:

I already heard. Thank you.

Meanwhile, we found another message plate left by the transportation team that revealed that they were moving towards the Plains of the Lizardmen. We hurriedly sent reinforcements, but they were destroyed after a fierce battle. he transportation unit was also largely destroyed, and Harkilgamed seems to be in hiding with the item somewhere near the Plains of the Lizardmen.

Your mission is go to Plains of the Lirardmen, defeat our enemies and rescue Harkilgamed.
