!Harkilgamed:

Whew! Thank you, my friend! Thanks to you we were able to protect a legacy of the Kamael, Enuma Arishu. We must make use of this brie respite to move it to a place of sefety.

Eh? I see that you are one of hoperfuls in the Big Sword class. If you continue on this patch, I am certain we will meet again. Utit then..
