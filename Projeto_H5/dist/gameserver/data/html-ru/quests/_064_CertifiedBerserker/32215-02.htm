!Master Tenain:

I see you have defeated the Breka Orcs sa ordered. Well done!

Unfortunately, the enemy has learned the location of the item. We will face more than simply Breka Orcs in the future... We are in the process of moving the item to a safer lovation. Those entrusted with doin so just left, so please follow them and help. They should be near Death Pass by now.
