Master Orkurus:

The Enuma Elish is one of te three mysthic weapons of thr Kamael: Enuma Elish, Leopold and Prahnah.

You have already met Harkilgamed, the great hero who once wielded the mighty sword Enuma Elish, whose blade can cut the gods themselves... If you become an expert with the Claymore, perhaps one day you too will wield the sword like Harkilgamed.
