!Master Tenain:

Yes, sir. Here is the situation, then:

The Breka Orcs have launched a series of attacks to steal the item we are protecting. We do not have the numbers for a static defense, so we have determined to go on the offensive and attack their stronghold to throw them into confusion. Go to the Breka Stronghold and defeat the Breka Orcs, The Breka Orc Archers, The Breka Orc Warriors, The Breka orc Shamans and The Breka Orc Overlords. Slay them and bring 20 Breka Orc Heads as proof.
