!Carevaner Gort:

Did Tenain send you? No a moment too soon! We are in seriuos trouble here. While transporting the goods, our convoy was attacked -- they seemed to know exacitly who and where we were. I was knocked unconscious during the battle, I regret to say, so I don`t know what happened... When I awoke, everyone was gone. But I Know that Harkilgamed would not let them take the item without a fight...

Members of the Berserker Guild are trained to leave a secret message in an event like this for the next team -- we should search the area at once!
