!Master Orkurus:

Are you sure you want to be a Berserker? To be a Berserker, you must first pass the test of our Berserker Guild.

You show promise, but I think you need additional training before you will be ready to undertake this test.

(This quest may only be undertaken by a Trooper class character who is level 39 or above.)
