!Cheiren:

Let me tell you about the mission.

Hunt <font color="LEVEL">Ragna Orcs</font> and the <font color="LEVEL">Evil Spirit of Baranka, the Destroyer of Baranka</font>. Since they are possessed by evil spirits emanating from the <font color="LEVEL">Ragna Orc Amulets</font> they wear, you must retrieve those accursed pendants. The more you bring me, the higher your reward.

Some Ragna Orcs carry the <font color="LEVEL">Soul Core Containing Evil Spirit</font> instead of an amulet. If you collect 10 of those, you may challenge the Leader of the Ragna Orcs to a duel. Do not do so lightly!
