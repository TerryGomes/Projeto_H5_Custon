!Cheiren:

You have brought back 10 Soul Core Containing Evil Spirits.. If I combine the power of this core with this pendant... Well, these are the <font color="LEVEL">Protection Soul's Pendant</font>. These are essential to confront the head of Raguna Orc <font color="LEVEL">Baranka</font>. Without these items, one can never be able to endure the energy of the evil spirit.

If you go to the altar of Kasha and kill it, it will be of a great help to weaken the evil spirit.

Anything else?
