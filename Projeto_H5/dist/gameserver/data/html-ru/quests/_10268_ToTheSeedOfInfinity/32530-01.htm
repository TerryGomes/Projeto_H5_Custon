<html><body>Officer Tepios:<br>
This letter of recommendation must be from Admiral Keucereus. We've been waiting for some capable adventurers! We will, of course, reward you for your efforts. It may not be as much as we would like, but know that when we have regained our land, you will always be welcomed here with honor.<br>
Well, I see that you have proven your ability to destroy the creatures inside the Death Gate.<br>
Tell me when you're ready for another mission. I have just the thing for you...
