When you enter the Seed from <font color="LEVEL">the Dock of the Seed of Infinity</font>, you will see my subordinate, <font color="LEVEL">Officer Tepios</font> at a place called the <font color="LEVEL">Death Gate</font>. Give him this letter of recommendation.<br>
To enter the Seed of Infinity, remember that you'll first need to <font color="LEVEL">teleport there through a person named Jaedin</font> at the <font color="LEVEL">Dock of the Seed of Infinity</font>.<br><br>
You must also acquire a <font color="LEVEL">Flying Transformed Object</font> in order to move through the skies of Gracia. You can do so by completing a simple mission assigned by <font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font>, a Dwarf located south of here or by purchasing a Transformation Scroll from <font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> next to him.
