The Seed of Infinity, located to the north of my Alliance Base, is a land of death governed by <font color="LEVEL">Ekimus</font>, the Lord of the Dead and a devout follower of Shilen.<br>
It is inhabited by the undead. The surrounding land has also been contaminated, so the only safe way to approach it is by air, either in a <font color="LEVEL">clan airship</font> or via <font color="LEVEL">transformation magic</font>.<br>
Heed my advice: many of the dangers here will exceed the individual skills of even the strongest adventurer. If at all possible, you should only venture there in the company of a powerful party.<br>
Do you understand?<br>
