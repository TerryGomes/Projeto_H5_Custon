<html><body>Keucereus:<br>
Take this <font color="LEVEL">letter of introduction</font>, which authorizes you to engage in action within the Seed of Infinity. It is a dangerous region, but this letter says that an adventurer like you can be trusted to carry out missions there.<br>
Deliver this letter to <font color="LEVEL">Officer Tepios</font> inside the Seed of Infinity and he will understand why I have recommended you.<br>
Be advised that first you must be <font color="LEVEL">teleported inside the Seed of Infinity by a person called Jaedin</font>, who you will find at the <font color="LEVEL">Seed of Infinity Dock</font>.<br>
You must also first acquire a <font color="LEVEL">Flying Transformed Object</font> in order to venture into the skies of Gracia. You may obtain one by completing a simple mission assigned by <font color="LEVEL">Engineer Lekon</font>, a Dwarf located south of here. Alternately, you can purchase a Transformation Scroll from <font color="LEVEL">Officer Tolonis</font> in the same place. Farewell and good luck!
