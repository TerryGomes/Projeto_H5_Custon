!Andellia:

Good work. Your soul has remained pure throughout your ordeal. We owe you a debt of gratitude for expelling those foul spirits from this holy forest.

About the truth of God you're looking for... It will be better to talk to *Wiseman Casian of the Wastelands*. He can be abrupt, but knows many stories of God that others do not know. He is even familiar with the knowledge known as 'vice.'
