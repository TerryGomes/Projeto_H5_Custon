!Priest Petron:

So you came to such a remote island to find the true religion of Einhasad...

I came here many years ago after I incurred the hatred of the High Priests.  Apparently I was trying to clarify the truth too specifically. Anyway, I much prefer the liberal atmosphere here over the corrupt inner circle.

...I have so much to tell you. But first I have a favor I must ask... Please get rid of the *malignant spirit Nahir* coiling in the *Elven Ruins*. This will enhance your learning. Please, will you deal with Nahir?
