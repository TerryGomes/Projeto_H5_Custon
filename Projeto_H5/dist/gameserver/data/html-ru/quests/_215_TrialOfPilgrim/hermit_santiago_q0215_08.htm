!Hermit Santiago:

Last of all, you must go to the land of the Elves. Inside the *Elven Village* is the Mother Tree, one of the purest forms of energy on earth. You will meet under this large and beautiful tree with *Andellia*, one of the protectors of the Mother Tree. She can teach you about Eva and Shilen.
