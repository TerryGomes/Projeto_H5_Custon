!Priest Primos:

So you seek the knowledge of Einhasad? I'm afraid I can't help you. I am embarrassed by the faithful. There are many truths concealed in the shrine's interest... There is nothing I can do about it...

If you want to know about Einhasad you should go to see *Priest Petron of Talking Island*.
