!Ancestor Martankus:

I am Martankus of the Hestui tribe! Although my body perished in battle thousands of years ago, my spirit watches over my descendants.

This place is a sacred tomb housing the remains of the greatest heroes of the seven tribes. Young Orcs still come here to test their courage, strength and skill!
