!Andellia:

Did you bring a message from Santiago? In search of the truth, are you? Your timing could not be better.

I have a favor to ask. There is a Priestess named *Uruha* in the Neutral Zone. She invaded this forest with her spirits known as *Black Willows*. You must destroy these spirits.

The Black Willows are located near the *Waterfalls in the northern part of the Neutral Zone*. After destroying them, *go to Uruha and warn her not to come to the Elven Forest ever again.* After you do this we can discuss what you seek.
