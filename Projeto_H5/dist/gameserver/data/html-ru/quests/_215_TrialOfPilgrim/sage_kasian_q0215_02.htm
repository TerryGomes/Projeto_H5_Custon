!Elder Casian:

I will never understand the Human propensity to assign a value of right or wrong to everything, even the behavior of the gods! The worst offenders are the Priests...

There is no crime as long as we act according to our feelings, am I right? After all, we are just the gods creations... So even if there is a crime, it is the gods' fault, not ours!

Well, I've said enough. Please go back to *Hermit Santiago*.
