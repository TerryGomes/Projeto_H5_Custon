!Hermit Santiago:

Ah, there's the glimmer in your eyes! You still have far to go and much to learn about the nature of truth, but this is a start.

Accept this *Mark of Pilgrim*. Remember, though, this is not the end of your studies. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, I perceive, the end of the beginning. Fare you well!
