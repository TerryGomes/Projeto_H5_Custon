!Hermit Santiago:

To properly use the power of the gods, you must first understand their nature. That learning process can be most intense... Many of a higher level than yours have tried and failed.  I think it would be too hard for you to endure at this moment. Come back after you have advanced your skills.

(This quest may only be performed by Clerics, Oracles, Shilen Oracles, and Orc Shamans of level 35 or higher)
