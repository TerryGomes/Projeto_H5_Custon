!Elder Casian:

Hello, my inquisitive friend. My name is Casian, known to some as 'the Sage of the Wastelands'.

The Elves and the Dark Elves that you have met have told you things that could be true or not. The nature of the gods is not known to mankind, and even they are only one small part of a very big universe... The gods each have a role to play. We cannot understand their intentions...

We shouldn't make things more difficult than they are. We must each just do the best we can and go about our daily lives...

I hope my lecture hasn't bored you. Take this book and return to *Hermit Santiago*. After all, this whole thing was his idea to begin with.
