!Priest of the Earth Gerald:

You have come to the right place! Maphr is my specialty! 6 years in the seminary, and 10 years of self-guided research after that...I feel that I have learned practically all there is to know about Maphr. I could use additional funds to further my research... Would you consider making a small donation? I will teach you everything I know about Maphr for a mere *100,000 adena*. What a deal, er, I mean, blessing it is!
