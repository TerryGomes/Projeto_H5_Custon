!Hermit Santiago:

Do you understand? You must meet with *Seer Tanapi of the Orc Village, Gauri Twinklerock of the Dwarven Village, Father Primoz of Giran Castle Town, and Andellia of the Elven Village*!  In that order!  Discern from them their ideas  on the nature of the gods... You may find this trial unsettling and shocking, but as a seeker of the truth you must endure.
