Hey, you! Why are you still here?<br>
Those monsters won't kill themselves, you know! Hunt <font color="LEVEL">Grave Robber Summoners, Grave Robber Magicians, Grave Robber Workers, Grave Robber Warriors, and Grave Robber Insane Warriors</font>, as well as their subordinates <font color="LEVEL">Servitors of Darkness, Phantoms of the Mine, Mine Bugs and Earthworm's Descendants</font>. Then bring me <font color="LEVEL">Mineral Fragments</font> as evidence. Anything to say for yourself?<br>
