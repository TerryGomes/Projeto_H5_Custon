Please destroy the following monsters in the Mithril Mine: <font color="LEVEL">Grave Robber Summoners, Grave Robber Magicians, Grave Robber Workers, Grave Robber Warriors and Grave Robber Insane Warriors</font>, since they seem to be the chief ones causing the trouble. While you're at it, destroy their subordinates in the Stakato Nest: <font color="LEVEL">Servitors of Darkness, Phantoms of the Mine, Mine Bugs and Earthworm's Descendants</font>. <br>
Bring me enough <font color="LEVEL">Mineral Fragments</font> as evidence and I will give you a reward: either a <font color="LEVEL">recipe</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Premium Materials</font> containing the secrets of Dwarven armor<br>
What are you still doing standing there? Get moving!
