According to my friend Sorcerer Esrandell, the curse originated from the despair of the dead soldiers. But the curse continued because of the power of black magic that surrounds the Underground Fortress. They say that the residual black magic of those dirty Dark Elves, and the power of the dark spirits that they summoned, seeped into the foundations of the fortress. There are even preposterous rumors that our proud Elven Mystics of light also used forbidden black magic in order to achieve victory over the Dark Elves ...

Anyhow, strong black magic powers still surround that place. After a long period of research, we have found an answer. If this force is neutralized, we should be able to counter the curse. First, my long time friend Sorcerer Esrandell says that he needs a complete skeleton of an undead monster in order to identify the black energy that abounds in the fortress. I would like you to travel to the abandoned Underground Fortress and bring me *bone fragments and skulls of the undead*. If you would help me lessen my burden, I will reward you handsomely.
