I give you my deepest gratitude. Go immediately to the *Underground Fortress* and bring me *ten undead bone fragments and three Elf skulls*. The skulls must be whole and intact, with no flaws. According to Sorcerer Esrandell, flawless and unscarred Elf skulls may only be obtained from the monsters called the *dark terrors*. Dark terror, mist terror and shade horror ... they are all related.

I wish to present my fellow soldiers, who have suffered long enough, with eternal peace as soon as possible. Please. Hurry.
