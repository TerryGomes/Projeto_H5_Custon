Did you know? The most intense battle against the evil Dark Elves took place in the Underground Fortress, which is now full of monsters. I was there when the last battle took place and still remember it vividly. I was so frightened that I thought only of my own safety, and left behind my screaming fellow soldiers as I ran away from the battle.

The deep sorrow and tears of those who died then acted as a powerful curse, and the corpses resurrected as undead. I should have chosen death like my fellow soldiers ... I am so ashamed that I am still alive ... I am so ashamed that I cannot even look up at the heavens ...

I wished to break the curse so that my friends could peacefully rest in the afterlife, and I have spent a long time with my old friend Sorcerer Esrandell, researching *ways to counter the curse of the Underground Fortress*. We have only recently discovered a method.
