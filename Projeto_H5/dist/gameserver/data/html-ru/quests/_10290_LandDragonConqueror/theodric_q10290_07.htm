!Antharas Watchman Theodric:

And so it is done. Antharas has been stopped and his return prevented.

I have something for you... something that I rarely am allowed to give. The <font color="LEVEL">Antharas Slayer Circlet</font> is yours.

What now? I stay, I wait, and I watch. Antharas can never truly be killed. I can only hope that brave warriors such as you come to help and stop Antharas whenever it attempts to return.
