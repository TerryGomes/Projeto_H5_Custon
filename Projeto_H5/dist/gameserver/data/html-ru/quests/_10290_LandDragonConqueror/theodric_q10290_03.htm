!Antharas Watchman Theodric:

Yes, Antharas can never really be killedâ€¦ not yet anyway. You may have heard stories from other adventurers how they have killed him again and again. Each time he is killed, he resurrects even more powerful. I fear that the greed of adventurers has caused Antharas to become overwhelmingly powerful.

You will need an army to follow you if you have any hope of defeating Antharas now.
