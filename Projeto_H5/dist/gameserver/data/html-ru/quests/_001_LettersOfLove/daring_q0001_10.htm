!Darin:

You brought the potion? Thank you! I've already bought roses and even finished the poem I was writing for Roxxy. Now that I have Baulro's potion, all that's left is for me to do is to go and talk to her. I know in my heart this is meant to be! I couldn't have done any of this without your help.

Please accept this small gift as a token of my gratitude. I'm afraid it's not much, but please know you have my undying thanks!
