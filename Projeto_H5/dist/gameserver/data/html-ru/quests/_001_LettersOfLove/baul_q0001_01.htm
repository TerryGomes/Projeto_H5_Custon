!Magister Baulro:

Darin sent you, eh? Well, well... He's a fine lad, but far too shy for his own good. I'm glad he's finally decided to tell Roxxy his feelings, though. None but the brave deserve the fair, eh!

Here's the "magic potion" he ordered. Just between us, it's nothing more than water drawn from the Temple well! Calm down -- I really do have Darin's best interests at heart. Think about it: if he believes that this will make him more eloquent, his self-confidence will soar and he really will find the words he needs. Now take it to him, and remember: not a word about the ingredients!
