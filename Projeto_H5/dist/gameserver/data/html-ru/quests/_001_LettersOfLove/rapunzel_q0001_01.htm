A letter...for me? From Darin? What does it say, I wonder... Oh my, I had no idea he had these feelings for me. I wish he hadn't waited so long to tell me!

Please give Darin my *handkerchief* as a pledge of my affection for him. And tell him...tell him not to waste any more time. Tell him to come see me right away!
