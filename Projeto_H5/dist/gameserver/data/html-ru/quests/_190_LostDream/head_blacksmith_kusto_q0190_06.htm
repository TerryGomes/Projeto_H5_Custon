!Head Blacksmith Kusto:

I see... So it really is extinct. As I told you before, I doubt there is anything to be gained financially from this line of research. Still, any knowledge must possess some value, don't you think? In any event, thank you for your efforts.

I have one final favor to ask of you: would you tell *Lorain* that the work I asked her to do is now finished? I don't think there is a need for me to have any further contact with her...
