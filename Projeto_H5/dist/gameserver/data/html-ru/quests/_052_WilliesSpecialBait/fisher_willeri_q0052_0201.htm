Thanks for the eyes. Take this *bait of land*. It finds more valuable items than baits of wind or chill.

Remember, this bait only works when your fishing level is exactly 16. Whether or not you land your catch will depend on your skill.

Remember, if you catch anything besides fish, bring it to me unopened! Don't even bother bringing me opened boxes.
