!Chamberlain Crosby:

I have been contacted by the lord's representative. I believe we should obtain the Mandragora Roots that Spellbook Seller Luke has requested.

Send one of your followers to search for the roots while you focus on obtaining information concerning the whereabouts of the resistance. Speak with Mercenary Captain Sophya, my lord -- she is fighting them and is very knowledgeable.
