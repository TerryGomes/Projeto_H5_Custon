I'm glad to hear that! Let me tell you a story.

The war has caused much sorrow here in Dion territory. But we have one hope. It is Mandragora! Mandragora can be cultivated only in our territory, and its root has begun to catch people's attention in Giran. Now real trade has begun. Unfortunately, the first merchant convoy was attacked by rebels. Unless we can restore faith in our ability to protect the merchants, our economy will fail. And if that happens, famine will follow.

Will you find 100 Mandragora roots to help boost trade? We will also need your help to ensure our merchants' safety near the rebels' hideout.
