Ah, a fine idea, my lord! Go see Spellbook Seller Luke in the Town of Dion. If you are able to help him resolve his problem, I think you will win his support. You don't have to do it yourself. If you prefer, you can select someone to act as your representative in this matter. Simply let me know who will do so once you have confirmed it with the person of your choice.
