!Mercenary Captain Sophya:

Well, I think I can give you some information. According to what we have learned, it looks like a new aide has been appointed for the Bloody Axe troop. He has changed their tactics. They've become more aggressive now.

But I think if we could eliminate that aide, everything will return to normal. We also know he's very devoted to his troops. If we kill enough Ol Mahum, my guess is that he'll show up... That's our chance.
