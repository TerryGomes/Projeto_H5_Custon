!High Priest Orven:

Wonderful! I can perform a ceremony of purification in order to put our heroes' souls back to rest. I'll need you to bring me  *Aden Residents Remains* from the undead around *Devastated Castle.* Our dead brothers came back from death in the form of *doom archers, doom guards and doom servants.* Given the power i can concentrate in a single ceremony you should take exactly *60 corpses* before you come back. Now please hurry, our brave soldiers deserve a proper rest!
