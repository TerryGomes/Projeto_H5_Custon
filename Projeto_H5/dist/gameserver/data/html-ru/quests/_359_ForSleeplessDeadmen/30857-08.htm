!High Priest Orven:

Of course you do... Here, take some materials that will hopefully make your pass for this world more grateful.

Unfortunately, there are so many heroes that won't find it's rest yet until we help them as we just did now! Can i ask you to keep your efforts so we can save more Aden residents' souls?
