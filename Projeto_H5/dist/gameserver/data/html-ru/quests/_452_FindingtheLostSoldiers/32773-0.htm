Officer Jakan:

Unless you've commanded men in battle, I doubt you could understand my mental state just now. I was forced to abandon most of my soldiers during the crash to save my life and those who near me. It weighs heavily on my heart. Death hangs over this land like the sky.

I can see in your eyes you don't understand the terror of this land. You should get out of here while you can and forget about this place.
