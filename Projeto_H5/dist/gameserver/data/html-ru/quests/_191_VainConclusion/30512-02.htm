I see. Hmm... Researching Cruma, eh? Interesting... Although there is nothing to be gained financially from it, unfortunately... But I suppose the research may still have some value, eh? Thank you for your help. Please take this in exchange for what you've done. I will send word later if I need your further help, adventurer. In the meantime, may Maphr thicken your beard and strengthen your sinews!
