!Khavatari Toruku:

To complete the Trial of Steel, you must fight against fighters of various races. The opponents you must knock down are the *Vuku Orc fighter, ratman fighter, Langk lizardman warrior, and Felim warrior*. Come back after you have collected three tokens from each race, for a total of 12 tokens.

And, don't forget, you must not use any weapon during the trial other than your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons. A true Monk must be able to fight without depending on weapons!
