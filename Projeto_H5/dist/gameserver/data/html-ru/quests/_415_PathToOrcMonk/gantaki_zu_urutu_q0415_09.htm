!Gantaki Zu Urutu:

Tejakar Oroka! You have brought the Fiery Spirit Scroll! Well done, young one! You have obtained the first of the 2 scrolls necessary to become a Monk.

To find the second scroll, journey to the Human land of Gludio and seek out *Prefect Kasman* in the village called *Gludin*. Show him this letter, and he will tell you how to find the scroll.

May the sacred flame guide you to success!
