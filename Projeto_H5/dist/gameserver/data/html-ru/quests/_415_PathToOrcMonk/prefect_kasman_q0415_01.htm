!Prefect Kasman:

To find the second scroll needed in order to become a Paagrio Monk, you must meet *Khavatari Toruku*. To meet him, you must follow the path that heads north from the village. He will be near the fork in the road. When you meet him, give him this fig.

Come back after you have completed his Trial of Steel and you receive the scroll.
