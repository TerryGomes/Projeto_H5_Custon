!Khavatari Toruku:

Come here, young Orc. What is this fig? Is it for me? I have not been able to drink one drop of water for more than a fortnight, so this will come in handy. Thank you!

I see you are a Fighter that wishes to become a Paagrio Monk. So, you have come to take the Trial of Steel from me! Steel is metal that has become harder in the flame! It refers to the training process of a Monk in reaching a higher level of strength.

The trial is to test your strength against fighter levels of other races that live in Gludio. Find the *Vuku Orc fighter, ratman fighter, Langk lizardman warrior, and Felim lizardman warrior* and knock them down! If you have gathered *3 tokens from each race, adding up to 12 tokens in all*, put them in this purse and bring them back.

Even if you fight a lower race, you could be defeated if you are absentminded. So keep your wits about you! And one thing more... you must not use any weapon during the trial, other than your bare fists or hand-to-hand weapons. A true Monk must be able to fight without depending on weapons!
