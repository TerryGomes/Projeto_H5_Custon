!Gantaki Zu Urutu:

As you know, Khavatari is a title bestowed on only the greatest Kabart martial art masters. Khavatari Rosheek left our village some time ago to further develop his skills. I have heard rumors that he is near the *Frozen Waterfalls in the northern part of the Immortal Plateau*.

But if you him to teach you, it would be wise for you to offer him a gift to show your respect. Here, take this Pomegranate. Perform all the tasks he gives you, no matter how difficult, and he will reward you with the scroll, which you must then bring back to me.

Ah, I almost neglected to tell you the most importatn thing: *while you are taking the test to become a Monk, you must not use any weapons other than fist-type weapons or your bare hands!* If you violate this rule, you will not be allowed to complete the test. Do not forget!
