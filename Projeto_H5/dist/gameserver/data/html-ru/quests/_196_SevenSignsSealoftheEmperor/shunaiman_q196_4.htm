The book itself will stay on this continent, and the clues will be in the <font color="LEVEL">Witness of Dawn</font>, and in the words of the <font color="LEVEL">Emperor's Key</font>.

Oh... and thank you. The Empire stands because of people like you... willing to bear its weight on your shoulders. I am... in your debt.
