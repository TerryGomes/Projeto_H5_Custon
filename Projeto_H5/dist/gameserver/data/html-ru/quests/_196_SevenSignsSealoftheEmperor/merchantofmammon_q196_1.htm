!Merchant of Mammon:

Was it you who summoned me from the Necropolis? Then you must have Shunaiman's contract in your possession....

We inked our names in that document 1500 years ago, but still the paper bears our names, and still we are bound to honor the terms set out in it.

I assume you have summoned me so that the clause can finally be honored?
