!Emperor Shunaiman:

Don't worry about me! I am built of simple flesh and bone, but the Empire... it houses the dreams of so, so many people.

Now, listen. The final room contains <font color="LEVEL">four sealing devices</font>, each of which need to be activated. You will then need to gather the <font color="LEVEL">four Binding Seals</font>... and bring them back to me.

Do not lose <font color="LEVEL">the sword</font>, and do not discard <font color="LEVEL">the holy water</font>--they are absolutely vital to our survival!
