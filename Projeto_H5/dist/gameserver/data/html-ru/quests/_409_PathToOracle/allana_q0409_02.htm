!Allana:

What was that monster? I'm afraid... I don't want to die... I don't want to abandon my brother and die!

I don't want to trick people anymore! However, Perrin didn't give me the money he owes me yet.

I wrote down all the work I've done until now in my *diary.* I will give this to you... Please help me get the money from Perrin...  I need that money to cure my brother's illness...

Perrin hides around here somewhere... Please... Please help me!
