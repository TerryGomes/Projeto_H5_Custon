!Priest Manuel:

Recently, there have been *rumors of a girl near Gludin Harbor that performs miracles*. We suspect that perhaps this girl may have the power to purify the world.

If that girl is truly the sacred flame mentioned in the prophecy, we must protect her. I have heard that there are already those who are using the prophecy of the sacred flame to hatch sinister plots. First, bring the girl to us.

Oh yes! Take this crystal necklace. It will aid you in revealing whether or not she is truly the sacred flame of the prophecy.
