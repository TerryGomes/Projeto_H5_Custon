Be patient. Ahem!%%
If you use the power of the Stone of Commune, you can understand the characters of the gods written on the Tablet of Vision. Also, if you hold the stone with your hands, you will know intuitively where the tablet is hidden. It isn't yet known who on earth made this. But this much is evident. Someone is secretly helping us learn the knowledge forbidden by the gods!%%
Then this stone that we took from the Benandanti member we killed may be the Stone of Commune! Take it! If what is written in the document is true, we can find the Tablet of Vision with it. Can you sense the location of the tablet? Then go immediately! I'll gather more information.
