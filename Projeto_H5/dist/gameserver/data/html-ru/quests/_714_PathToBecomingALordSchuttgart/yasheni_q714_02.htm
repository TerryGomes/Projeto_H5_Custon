!Warehouse Chief Yasheni:

Um... .

I'd like to support you, but...can you demonstrate that you indeed have the ability to rule the territory? If so, you'll definitely have my support. I heard that you solved the problem of Pavel's Ruins. How about you deal with the Golems that have infested that place now? You don't have to destroy them all, obviously! Defeating even 300 or so Golems near the ancient research center will help us feel much safer here.
