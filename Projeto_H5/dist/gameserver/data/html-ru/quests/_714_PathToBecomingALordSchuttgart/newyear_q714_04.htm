!Head Blacksmith Newyear:

Thanks to you, we can finally put an end to Pavel's final experiment! If only someone like you were to become lord of Schuttgart...

Now we have only Dr. Chaos and a couple thousand violent Golems to deal with. That won't be a problem for our Black Anvil Guild, but I know those Iron Gate Guild yokels will complain. Would you mind speaking to them and calming them down? Warehouse Chief Yaseni is the head of the Iron Gate Guild in Schuttgart.
