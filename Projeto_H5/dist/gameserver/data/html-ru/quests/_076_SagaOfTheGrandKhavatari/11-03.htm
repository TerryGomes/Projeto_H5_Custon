The power of the ancient Orcs that you seek was created by the gods, but stolen by devils.%%
Find the* Archon of Halisha* inside the Four Sepulchers at the Human Imperial Tomb!%%
If entering is too difficult, go to the Shrine of the Loyal and fight Halisha's minions! He'll show up if you kill enough of them.%%
