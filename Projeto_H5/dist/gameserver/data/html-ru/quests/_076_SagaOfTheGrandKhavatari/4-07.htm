!Khavatari Kashu:

Did he withdraw?%%
Excellent! Even with both of us fighting against him, we faced a serious risk of being turned into blackened pieces of Charcoal!%%
Your level of Khavatari is quite impressive! Well, I guess that's obvious since you've made it this far, right...?%%
Skahi told me about you when we lost our brother to that beast! At that moment, I placed all my trust in you!%%
Now, give me your hand.
