Ah, the new model calculator!  Good job!  You shall be rewarded for this!  Give me a moment while I check it out!

Is this how this works?

Aaargh! Do you actually think that this is a new mofel?

Well, sorry to tell you this, but this calculator can only handle simple equations.  It's of no use to me at all.  I suppose, however, you still should be paid for your efforts.

How does 1,000 adena sound?  Or, if you prefer, you can have the calculator.  It's your choice!
