!Blacksmith Silvera:

Ha!  The Calculator?  Why are you bothering me for it?  Certainly you can find another Dwarf to get one from!

Okay.  You win.  Actually, I'm tired of carrying it around.  I hoped to exchange it for something more useful or pretty, but in this village, nobody has anything interesting...Sigh!

Bring me something pretty and I'll give you the calculator!  I want some new crystals, and I know just where you can find some!  Not far from here the *gemstone beasts* hoard their crystals.  They shine so brightly it shouldn't be hard to find them.

Oh, I can't wait!  Bring me 10 crystals from the *gemstone beasts* and I'll give you the calculator.
