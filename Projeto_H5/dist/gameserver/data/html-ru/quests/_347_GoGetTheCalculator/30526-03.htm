!Blacksmith Brunon:

Ah, you're back!  Did you bring the *new model calculator*?  Not yet?  Why not?  As I said, you should check with the *Trader Guilds*.  I am sure they brought it into the village.  If you keep looking you will find it.

Surely you know by now that the guilds you should check with are the *Silver Scale Guild* and the *Golden Wheel Guild*...

Get going!
