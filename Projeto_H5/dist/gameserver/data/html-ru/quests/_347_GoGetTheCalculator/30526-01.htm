!Blacksmith Brunon:

Over the long years of trading, the dwarves have created a tool to help traders with their calculations.  At first it was a very simple device, but over time they were able to make them better and capable of more complex computations.  I find this very useful and I always wish to get the latest model of this *calculator*.  Recently a new one was created.  I heard it has been brought to town but I have not seen it yet.  I do not know where to look for it, but I am sure the *Trader Guilds* brought it into town.

As you probably already know, there are two trader guilds in this village: the *Silver Scale Guild* and the *Golden Wheel Guild*.

I do not have the time to go and search for it.  Do you think you can check the leaders and people from these guilds to find me the *newest model calculator*?  I will, of course, pay you for your efforts.
