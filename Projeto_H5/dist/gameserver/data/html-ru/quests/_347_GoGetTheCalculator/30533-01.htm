!Silver Scale's Balanki:

A new type of calculator, eh?  Well, unfortunately, our guild does not make these, but I could tell you who does

Of course, as you know, nothing comes for free.  However, this shouldn't be much, just a small token of good faith...

I'll give you the information for only 100 adena. It's not like I need the money...As you know, I am an elder, and such sums are nothing to me.  All I require is a demonstration of your gratitude
