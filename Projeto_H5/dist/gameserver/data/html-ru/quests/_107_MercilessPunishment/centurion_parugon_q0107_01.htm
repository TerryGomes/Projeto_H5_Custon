!Centurion Parugon:

Young Orc, are you in charge of Hatos's mission? Somehow, you don't look trustworthy enough!

But, for now, I will tell you what you should know. Baranka's messenger is about to leave the eastern part of the Immortal Plateau, and move to the *Frozen Waterfalls*. You can reach the Frozen Waterfalls by traveling northeast.

Baranka's messenger is accompanied by escorts, so be careful. You will be able to catch them if you leave now! Hurry!!
