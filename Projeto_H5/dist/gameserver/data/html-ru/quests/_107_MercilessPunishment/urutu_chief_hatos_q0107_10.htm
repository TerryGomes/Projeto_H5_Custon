!Urutu Chief Hatos:

What, even the Elves? Baranka, has he truly forgotten the pride of the Orcs?!

I, Urutu Chief Hatos, declare this! The traitor cannot be forgiven. I will prepare the cruelest punishment for Baranka, for betraying his own people!

And you! Urutu Chief Hatos is very pleased! I will give you a great reward!
