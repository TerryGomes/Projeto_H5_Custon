!Urutu Chief Hatos:

Tejakar Oroka! Good! First, we must capture Baranka's followers!

Once you catch them, do whatever you'd like with them! But first, find out what they are plotting, and report to me!

Ask *Centurion Parugon* about the traitor's followers! He is in the northern part of the village. Leave at once!
