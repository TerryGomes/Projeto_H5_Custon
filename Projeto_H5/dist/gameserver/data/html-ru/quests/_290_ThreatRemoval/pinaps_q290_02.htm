!Guard Pinaps:

The mission is simple: Kill them. The recruits, the instructors, every Sel Mahum you find in the Sel Mahum Training Grounds. They cannot be allowed to continue their training. Gather <font color="LEVEL">over 400 Sel Mahum tags</font> and bring them to me. I will reward you.., I know you fight for more than honor.
