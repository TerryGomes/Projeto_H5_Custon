Very well. First, i need a report about the military
strength, chain of command and supply status of
the "Abandoned Camp" forces that threaten this area.

In order to obtain such a report, you must
infitrate the enemy at their very center. But I am
worried about giving such a complicated mission
to a greenhorn like you.

Hmmm... Your mission will be to obtain that
report from their leaders, whoever and wherever
they may be.

Go to the Abandoned Camp, defeat the OI Mahum Novices
and obtain 10 OI Mahum orders. Then eliminate the OI Mahum Patrols and
obtain 5 OI Mahum marks. Good luck, soldier!
