!Master Sione

Our Kamael Steelfile is different from other
combat groups. We are a apecial force particularly
suited for information gathering, reporting,
determitins, attacking supply lines and
conducting raids behind enemy lines.

These activities suit natural abilities of
female Kamael, which is why our unit was
formed.

Our Steelfile exam is no different... We will
examine your skills to see if and where you
would fit into our overall strategy...

We have a good mission available for your test.
Do your best!
