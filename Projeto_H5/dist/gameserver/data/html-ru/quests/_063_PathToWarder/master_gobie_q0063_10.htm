!Master Gobie:

Ah! You have returned.

And i see this has been another eventful errand...

I too have been confused when dealing with
some of these other races.

The races of the Outer World and the evil
creatures have complicated relations...

Still, as an intelligence officer, it is my task to
make sense of all this conflicting information.

As you wrote in you report, we do not know
whether the races of the Outer World and the evil
creatures communicate secretly or use each
other to gain thier ends..

Certaintly, the relations between them are complicated
and often bloody.
