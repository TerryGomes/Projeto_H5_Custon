!Master Gobie:

(Reads the documents carefully.)

Hmm... Good job...

I will analyze the information you collected and
draft futher orders for you...

(Master Gobie scribbles a note.)

Here, take this letter to Captain Bathis of the Town
of Gludio and return to me.

While you deliver this, i will despatch our elite Xekerin Troops to
capture Tak, a staff officer of the OI Mahum.

Go quickly!
