!Master Gobie:

Speak up! Captain Bathis must have treated you
with contempt, eh ?

A good lession fro you, is that not all the races in
this Outer World see us the same way.

Some respect us as equals, others see us simply
as sword fodder in battle.

Even individuals within a race treat us differently...

As newcomers to the mainland, we dare not risk offending any
of these reces now.

In fact, our orders are to provide assistance to
each of them impartially.

So, we must learn to govern our tempers...
