!Master Gobie:

Well, if you  say so...

I have my doubts, but our options are limited.

Do it, then!

According to a report one of our men found on
the body of one Xekerin Troops, Tak is
hiding with the Maille Lizardmen.

Take this Soul Crystal and go to the Maille
Lizardmen Barraks. If you slay the Maille
Lizardmen, Tak, a staff officer of the OI Mahum,
will appear.

When Tak is sufficiently weakened, he can be captured
using this Soul Crystal.

Good hunting!
