!Master Gobie:

Did you deliver the report?

I have recived deeply troubling news: our
Xekerin Troops were all but annihilated. Our
rangers discovered their corpses.

Tak, the staff officer of the OI Mahum we sought
to captute, must have known of our plans!

I have no additinal troops to devote to this task
-- what shall we do ?
