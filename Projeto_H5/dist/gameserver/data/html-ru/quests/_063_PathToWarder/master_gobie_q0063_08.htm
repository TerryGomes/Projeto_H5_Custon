!Master Gobie:

Hmmm... We have lost contact with the Xekerin
Troops. That is not necessarily unusual during an
operation, but they have remained out of contact
longer this time...

Still, since they are all elite warriors, i am not overly
concerned... yet.

I do have an another document for you to deliver.

Take this to Grand Master Tobias of the Dark Elf Guild
in the Town of Gludio and return.
