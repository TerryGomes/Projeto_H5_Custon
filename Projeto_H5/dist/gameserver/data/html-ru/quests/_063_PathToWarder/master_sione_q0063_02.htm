!Master Sione:

Soldier, I was an officer of the force that ventured into the outer world to collect information while you were still in training on the island.

I am sure you understand that female Kamael are better at more refined, skill-oriented combat techniques than those that rely on sheer physical strength.

Come see me again after you have acquired enough experience to take the test to become a Warder.

(Only characters level 18 and above may undertake this quest.)
