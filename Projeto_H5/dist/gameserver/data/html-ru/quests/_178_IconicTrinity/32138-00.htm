!Hierarch Kekropus:

The time has come for you to leave this Island. Before you leave, there is something you must know, a hidden truth about the Kamael.

Knowing this truth may place you in danger, which is why only those who have exhibited exceptional courage and skill are offered the chance to learn it. From what I have seen, you are not yet ready...

(Only Kamael characters over level 17 may undertake this quest.)
