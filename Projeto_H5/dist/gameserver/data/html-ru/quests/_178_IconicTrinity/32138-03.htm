That expression... guess you have heard everything. Good job.
To us Kamael, there exists an "Erased History" that can not be told to the public. Of course, I can tell you everything about the "Erased History" here. However, as long as you were born a Kamael, I thought you had to at least know that before leaving the Isle of Souls.
