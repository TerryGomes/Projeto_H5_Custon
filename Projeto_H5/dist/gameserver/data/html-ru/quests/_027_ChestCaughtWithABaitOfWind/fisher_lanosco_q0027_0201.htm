I think this is the *large blue treasure box*
that my client lost.
It seems to contain a blueprint of golem.
The only blacksmith in this whole area capable of making such a thing is Shaling in this village.
She told me recently that she had dropped a box containing a blueprint in the river while she was traveling.
This must be it!
Please take this blueprint of golem to Shaling in the Blacksmith Shop.
