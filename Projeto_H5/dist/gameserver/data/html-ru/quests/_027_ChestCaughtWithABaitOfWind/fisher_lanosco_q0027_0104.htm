A while back someone was here asking about a *large blue treasure box*.
The bait I gave you earlier was designed to find it! Don't look so hurt!
It only works if the person using it doesn't know about it.
If you haven't found it yet, please continue to look for it.
Only you can use that bait now.

This should be easy for you!
I can't tell you who the *large blue treasure box* belongs to now, but I will if you find it! It was lost near the shore.
Look for it there.
Your fishing skill must be level 9 and you must bring the box to me unopened.
Someone else may have found it by now, so make sure to ask around about it in the market.
