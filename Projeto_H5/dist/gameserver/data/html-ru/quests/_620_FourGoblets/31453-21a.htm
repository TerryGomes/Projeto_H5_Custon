!Nameless Soul:

By the way, my friend really hates the shadows of Halisha, and won't show up until you've defeated them. I don't have enough power to open the Sealed Boxes, so you'll need my companion to open them for you.

*My friend collects relics from the ancient Empire. Bring him some and he'll exchange it for something good...* You can find out more from him.
