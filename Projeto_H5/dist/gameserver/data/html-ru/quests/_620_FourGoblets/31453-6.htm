!Nameless Spirit:

The nobles who unknowingly came here to worship were cruelly massacred by evil creatures. Maybe we could get the passes from their corpses!

They won't be easy to find, however. The *ghost of an adventurer* that haunts the gate of the Imperial graveyard will give us one if we do him a favor. The passes can only be used once, so you should get a few.

The pass isn't the only requirement for entry, though!
