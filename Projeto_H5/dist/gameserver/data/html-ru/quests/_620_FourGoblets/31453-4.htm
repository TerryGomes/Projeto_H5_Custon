!Nameless Spirit:

I've got just the guy for the job! *He'll open them for you.* Some of the boxes will be empty, but you'll get lucky eventually! You can keep everything you find!

*My friend collects relics of the Empire. Bring him some and he'll give you something nice!*

Oh! I almost forgot! There are hidden traps set at the enterances to this sepulcher to discourage trespassers...
