!Nameless Spirit:

Don't worry! Show your *used sepulcher pass* to the *ghost of Elmoreden's chamberlain* at the Pilgrim's Temple. She'll teleport you here again. The pass will let her know that you've been here before. You can find another *ghost of Elmoreden's chamberlain* near the gate of the Wall of Argos.

Well, you got all that? What do you think? Will you help me?
