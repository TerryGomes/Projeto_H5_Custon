!Nameless Soul:

Don't worry! Show your *used sepulcher pass* to the *ghost of Elmoreden's chamberlain* at the Temple of Pilgrims. She'll teleport you back here. The pass proves that you've been here before. You can find another *ghost of Elmoreden's chamberlain* near the gate of the Wall of Argos.
