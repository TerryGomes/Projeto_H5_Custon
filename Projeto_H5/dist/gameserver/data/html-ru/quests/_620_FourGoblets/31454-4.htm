!Ghost of Wigoth:

Take the four glasses you gathered to the *Nameless Soul* in the Four Sepulchers later. If you like, I can open the *Sealed Boxes* for you.]

Are you still gathering *relics of the Elmoreden Empire*? If you bring me *1000 relics*, I'll trade them for a *grade S weapon recipe*. Call it nostalgia.
