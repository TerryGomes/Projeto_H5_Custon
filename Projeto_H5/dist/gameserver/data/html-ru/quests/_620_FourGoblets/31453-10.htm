!Nameless Spirit:

Naturally, I have a plan! After you defeat the shadows of Halisha, *my friend will come and let you out.* He'll teleport you to the Pilgrim's Temple and open the sealed boxes for you.

My companion doesn't care for the shadows of Halisha, and he won't show up until they're all dead. Basically, you must defeat all the shadows if you are to escape! *Don't forget to ask my friend to open all the boxes when you meet him.*
