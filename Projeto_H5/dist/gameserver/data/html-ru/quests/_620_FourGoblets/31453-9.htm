!Nameless Spirit:

Different shadows of Halisha inhabit each sepulcher. Each one has four different kinds of goblets. *The four shadows are likely to appear in any location.* This may turn out to be harder than you thought!

Anyway, if you take the goblets from the shadows of Halisha, the door you came in through will be closed.
