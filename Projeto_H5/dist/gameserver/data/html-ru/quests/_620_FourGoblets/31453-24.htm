!Nameless Soul:

When it is time for the party to leave the sepulcher, they are sent to the Temple of Pilgrims. You must defeat the shadow of Halisha before the next entry time.

The sepulcher has several interconnected rooms, and you must find keys to open the locked doors. You can get the keys from evil creatures that appear when you open a suspicious box. Doors close periodically, so you'd better use them while they're open!

You'll find the shadows of Halisha in one of the rooms.
