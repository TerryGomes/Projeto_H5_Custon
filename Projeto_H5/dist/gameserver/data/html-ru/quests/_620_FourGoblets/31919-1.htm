!Ghost Chamberlain of Elmoreden:

Ah, you're helping him, eh? I'm not that strong anymore, but I've broken a seal or two! *Unfortunately, when I try to do it now, it rarely works! I've started breaking quite a few boxes, too!* But if you don't mind the risk, I'll try to open the box for you.

[Quest _620_FourGoblets 19|"Open the box."]
