!Nameless Soul:

After defeating the Shadow of Halisha, a friend of mine will come and teleport you to the Temple of Pilgrims. He'll open the Sealed Boxes for you there... Of course, if you don't defeat the shadow of Halisha in time, you'll be sent to the Temple of Pilgrims.

It's quite a distance from the Temple of Pilgrims to the Imperial graveyard, isn't it?
