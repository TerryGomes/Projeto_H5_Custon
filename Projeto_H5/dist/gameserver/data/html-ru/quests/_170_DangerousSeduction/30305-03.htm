!Tetrarch Vellior:

Have you ever suffered the pain of not being able to sleep? I have lately been plagued every night by *bad dreams*. Every night a beautiful woman with fair skin white as snow and hair black as ebony comes to my side and places her blood-red lips near my ear, speaking horrendous and unspeakable things with a hissing voice like a snake that makes my insides burn ...

The strangest thing is, when I wake up, I cannot remember any of her terrifying, chilling stories. I have called upon all of my magic knowledge, but I have yet to find out the identity of the culprit responsible for sending a devil into my dreams. But I have been able to find out the identity of the monster that appears in my nightmare. It is the *succubus* named *Merkenis*, who makes her home inside of the abandoned *School of Dark Arts*. I do not know what her purpose is, but I want to escape from this cursed nightmare as soon as I can. Won't you put an end to this spiteful monster for me?
