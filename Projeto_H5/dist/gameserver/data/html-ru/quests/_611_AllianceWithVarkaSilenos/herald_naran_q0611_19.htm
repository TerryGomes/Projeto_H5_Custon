!Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:

What are you still doing here? Get to the battlefield immediately!

You've promised us you'd bring from the *Ketra Orcs 300 badges of grunts, 300 badges of officers, 200 badges of captains and a Feather of Valor*. This feather can be obtained by undertaking the *Prove Your Courage* quest, a mission assigned by Ashas Varka Durai, the elder of our tribe.
