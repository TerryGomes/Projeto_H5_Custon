What are you still doing here? Get to the battlefield immediately!

Remember, you've agreed to bring *300 badges of Ketra grunts, 200 badges of Ketra officers and 100 badges of Ketra captains*.

You can get the General's Badge by slaying the *Ketra Orc Generals, Battalion Commanders, Grand Seers, Head Shamans, Head Guards, Prophets, Prophet's Guard, and Prophet's Aide*.

If you don't like your job, you're always welcome to quit!
