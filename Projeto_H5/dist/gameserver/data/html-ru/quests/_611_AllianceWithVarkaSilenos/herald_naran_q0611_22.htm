!Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:

What are you still doing here? Get to the battlefield immediately!

You've promised to bring *400 badges of Ketra grunts, 400 badges of Ketra officers, 200 badges of Ketra captains and a Feather of Wisdom*. This feather can be obtained by undertaking the *Slay the Enemy Commander* quest, a mission assigned by Ashas Varka Durai, the elder of our tribe.

Remember, you can always quit!
