!Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:

You seem pretty sure of yourself, but we can't afford to take in just anybody...

If you wish to fight alongside the Varka Silenos, you must drive the Ketra Orcs from their advance base! Destroy the *Ketra Orc footmen, raiders, scouts, shamans and war hounds* and bring back *100* badges of Ketra grunts, then you will have proven your ability. Show us what you can do!
