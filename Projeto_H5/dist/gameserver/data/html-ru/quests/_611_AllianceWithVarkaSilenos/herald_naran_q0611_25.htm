!Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:

Friend of Varka. I, Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk, must warn you, friend of Varka! Once you end our alliance, we will become as strangers... as if we never met! Earning our friendship again will mean starting over at the beginning. Are you sure you want to quit?
