!Varka's Messenger Naran Ashanuk:

Are you still here? If you want to be a friend of the Varka Silenos, you must go to the advance base of the Ketra Orcs and kill them all! Kill their *footmen, raiders, scouts, shamans and war hounds*. Bring back *100 badges of Ketra grunts*, then you will have proven your friendship to the Varka.
