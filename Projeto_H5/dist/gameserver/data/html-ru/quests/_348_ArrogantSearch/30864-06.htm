...The book of the saint, the branch of the saint and the blood of the saint! Finally, the three sacred relics, gathered in one place! Magnificent! Now I shall make it possible for you to stand before the demented king! In the mean time, I need you to run an easy errand for me. Please go to the grocery store and get me *a bottle of healing potion* and *five antidotes*. While you are doing this I will finish getting things organized.
