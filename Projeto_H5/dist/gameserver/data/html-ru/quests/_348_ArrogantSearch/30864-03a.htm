!Magister Hanellin:

You are not thinking about quiting already, do you? Have you forgotten what I asked of you? Here is what I wish of you for now: go to the Giants Cave, defeat a *Lesser Giant Elder* or a *Lesser Giant Mage* and bring back the Titan's Powerstone that they carry. I only need one stone, so it shouldn't be too hard for you.
