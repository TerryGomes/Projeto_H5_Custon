!Magister Hanellin:

You are back again...but you are not done with the last task I asked of you. Listen carefully: 
You need to dip the cloth in the blood of a *Platinum Tribe Overlord* or a *Platinum Tribe Shaman*. Once you have made the cloth completely red from their blood, come back to me and I promise to tell you a secret.
