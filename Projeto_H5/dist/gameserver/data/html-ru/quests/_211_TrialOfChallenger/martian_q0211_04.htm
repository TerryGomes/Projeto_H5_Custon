!Martien:

So, you have killed Gorr? Congratulations! Unfortunately, just now the villagers of Floran were attacked again by another evil creature.

This time the creature is called *'Baraham'*. Perhaps he came to avenge the death of Gorr... Anyway, *you should search the other caves near Gorr's shelter...*
