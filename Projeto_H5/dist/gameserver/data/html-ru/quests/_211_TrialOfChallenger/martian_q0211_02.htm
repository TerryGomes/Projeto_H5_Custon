Let's see then, what would be appropriate...?  Ah, yes!  There is *an evil creature attacking the villagers of Floran* in recent days. He has been called *'Gorr'*. He lives in a *cave near Floran* and attacks innocent villagers at random.

Go and kill this evil creature. "The hero who saved a village"... Doesn't this sound like someone who might carry such a mark?
