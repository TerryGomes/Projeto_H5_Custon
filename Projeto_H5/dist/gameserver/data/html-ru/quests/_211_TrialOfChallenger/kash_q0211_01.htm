You wish to earn the *Mark of the Challenger*? Of course, you already know that it is not an easy task, right? It is not something that can be taken lightly, especially by unskilled persons like yourself... Do not act so rashly, but think of your abilities...!

(This quest may only be performed by Warriors, Elven Knights, Palus Knights, Orc Marauders, or Orc Monks of level 35 or higher.)
