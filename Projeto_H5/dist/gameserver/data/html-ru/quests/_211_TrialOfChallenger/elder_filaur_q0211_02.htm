!Elder Filaur:

You fool! Why are you still here? Can you not even manage such an easy task on your own? 

Well... I understand the burden of having the responsibility of saving the world on your shoulders... But if you want to prove your valor to Fighter Raldo, you must take care of this!

Go to the *deepest parts of the Mithril Mines* and put an end to the monsters that are attempting to destroy the shield! Leave at once!
