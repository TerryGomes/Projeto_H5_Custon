Deal! Spit on the ground and let's shake on it. With this, our contract is sealed in the eyes of the goddess of earth, Maphr. Now listen to what I have to say.

Do you remember the eight basic ingredients used for my magic research that I told you about earlier? We can find some of them in this area. If you'll hunt for *monster eyes*, you can get their useful *Monster Eye Carcasses,* and once in a while, you may even obtain a *Monster Eye Lens*.  This is a very valuable item. They say Dwarves use these to make something called "eye glasses."

Also, if you hunt the *Basilisk*, you can get its gizzard. The Basilisk swallows the pebbles of the wastelands to aid its digestion, but inside, they are mixed with jade shards. So we can obtain jade from the *basilisk gizzard*.

You can find monster eyes at the bends of the Ruins of Agony or the Ruins of Despair. The basilisk can be found within the Wastelands. There are also monster eyes in the Wastelands, but they are much more dangerous than those at the bends of the Ruins, so you must be careful. But you may be able to find items that are that much more precious, so it is worth taking the challenge.

From now on, the items you bring to me I will sell to the Ivory Tower. I have already signed a Contract with the magicians of the Ivory Tower and fixed the price as well. I will give you 30% of the item price I have agreed to take. So please bring back as much as possible. Well then, may the blessing of the earth be with you, partner.
