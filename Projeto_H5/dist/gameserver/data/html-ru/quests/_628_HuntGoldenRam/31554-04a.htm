!Mercenary Kahman:

There are two classes here, rookie and elite.

An elite mercenary is a veteran with a long record of active service. The title earns you special priviliges.

Rookies must kill Needle Stakatos as well as Splinter Stakatos to gain elite status. Collect *one-hundred Chitins each of Splinter Stakatos and Needle Stakatos* to earn the title.

Show them what you're worth!
