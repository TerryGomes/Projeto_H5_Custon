!Warehouse Freightman Romp:

We of the Iron Gate Guild work hard every day to keep the items deposited by customers safe and secure. We're always looking for new ways to improve our security.

Recently we've been using infernium to reinforce our doors, locks and outer walls. You can have the utmost confidence in the strength of our warehouse, the apex of workmanship of the Iron Gate Guild. It's the apex of workmanship of the Iron Gate Guild. But...  No, I'm afraid you aren't ready for this...
