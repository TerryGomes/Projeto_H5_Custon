You still haven't found the *rare golden clover coin*. I won't give you the high-quality coin collection book for free. At the last meeting of the Coin Collection Club, they concluded that there were too many high-level coin collection books. They've forbidden me to sell them. The *rare golden clover coin* was stolen by the *Fallen Chieftain Vegus* in the *Forsaken Plains*.
