!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Very well! You must prepare to impress the committee... There is an excellent opportunity available, I've heard a strange rumor...

It's said that *Kail's Coins were discovered in the Forsaken Plains*. At one time Kail was Beleth's right-hand man. Bring me some of these coins. Also, if you buy a *"Coin Collecting Album" from Trader Sandra of Giran that she sells only when she is in a good mood*. Then, you will surely be chosen by the committee!
