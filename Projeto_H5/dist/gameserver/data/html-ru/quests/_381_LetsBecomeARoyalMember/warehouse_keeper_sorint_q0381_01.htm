!Warehouse Keeper Sorint:

Welcome! Come on in! I was about to ask you over anyway! I believe we've had this discussion before, am I right? About the special membership? Anyway, a special committee has been formed of members from all locations of the coin collectors club to decide upon whom to bestow the honor of a Royal Membership! Are you up to the challenge?
