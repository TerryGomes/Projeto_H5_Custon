!Fishermen's Guild Member Willie:

 A while back someone was here asking about a  a *small purple treasure box*.
 The bait that I gave you before was designed to find it. The problem is that the bait occasionally catches other
 things, but it's the best hope you have of recovering the box. If you've found the box,
 please give it to me. If not, I must ask you to go and find it for me.

I apologize for being untruthful earlier. The bait works better if the fisherman doesn't know about
 its properties. Bring me the *small purple treasure box*
 and I'll tell you who it belongs to! He lost it near the shore. Look for it there.
 Remember, your fishing skill must be level 16, and you must bring the box to me unopened.
 Someone else may have already found it, so ask around in the market.
