This seems to be the *small purple treasure box* that my client lost. When I opened it,
 I found this *Small Glass Box*.
 It has the names of *Anabel* and *Liesel* engraved on it.
 I don't know who Liesel is, but Anabel is my client. Anabel is a Magister in Heine Castle Town.
 She's kept the temple there for centuries. Please deliver this glass box to her.
