!Fishermen's Guild Member Linneus:

You already came back.  Being such a famous person, you clearly have different ability. 
You've obtained all the bait materials to make the bait with the attributes of flame, haven't you? 
Frankly, I should charge you for the production itself, but wouldn't do that since you're a well-known soldier.
 This is also a type of advertisement.  This bait utilizes the repulsive force between the elements.
 Like the water and fire don't mix together, the things sunken like boxes in the water will float if you use the *Bait of Flame*. 
 Then, will you give me the materials that you got now?
