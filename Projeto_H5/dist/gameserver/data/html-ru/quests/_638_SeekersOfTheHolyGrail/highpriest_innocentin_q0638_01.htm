!High Priest Innocentin:

Recent activities at the Pagan Temple have raised my concerns. Considering the shenanigans that normally go on there, you must surely understand the peril!

You see, they've set their sights on Saint Solina's Grail of Splendor! I'm sure that if we don`t stop them, something terrible and irrevocable will happen! Will you help us in our time of need?
