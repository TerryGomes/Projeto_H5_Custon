!High Priest Innocentin:

Please go to the *Pagan Temple* and defeat the evil ones that inhabit it! After you've destroyed them, bring me their *Pagan Totems*. You'll be well-rewarded if you bring more that *2000* of them! Of course, our definitions of large rewards might differ...

As you must have guessed, the Pagan Temple is heavily defended and will not easily overtaken. *Priest Eliyah could give you guidance on how to penetrate their defence*.
