!Master Virgil:

You need your own coffin to perform the second trial, the *Ritual of the Red Coffin*. Yes, I'm speaking of the coffin you use to bury an elf when he dies. According to the funeral customs of the Dark Elves, we need a traditional coffin made from the carapace of a beast. You must make this yourself.

You should ask *Abyssal Celebrant Kalinta* how to make a coffin. You can meet her if you go to the *Dark Elven Guild of the village of Gludin*. You must take this letter with you.
