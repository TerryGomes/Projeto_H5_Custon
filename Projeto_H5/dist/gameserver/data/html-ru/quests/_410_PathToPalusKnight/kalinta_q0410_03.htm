Still here, eh? Caution is a virtue, but a true knight knows that he must fulfill his commitments in a timely fashion.

As you know, you must gather *five Arachnid Tracker Silk skeins and one carapace of a giant poison spider to create a Coffin of Eternal Rest.*

Giant poison spiders and arachnid trackers can be found in the Windmill Hill area in the southern part of Gludin Village or at the Fellmere Harvesting Grounds over the northern valley.
