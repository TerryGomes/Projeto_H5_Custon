!Master Virgil:

Before you receive the trial, take this talisman. Those who follow Shilen will see it and know that you are a fighter performing a task. The first trial is the *ritual of 13 skulls.* Its object is to collect 13 enemy skulls killed by your own hand. It is a ritual to meditate upon the death that the Knight brings with his sword. Throw out all private emotions and perform the task with a solemn heart. Do not forget that Shilen will be watching over your path.

I will tell you about the enemy you must kill in this ritual. If you travel on the road that heads north of the village, you will come to the *Neutral Zone.* It is an area where combat is forbidden, according to agreement, because it is the boundary area between the two Elven tribes. There are creatures gathering their strength in the Neutral Zone, and taking advantage of the situation because Elven soldiers cannot enter.

These creatures are the *lycanthrope* -- half-Human, half-animal. They are slowly getting stronger in the Neutral Zone, and are even setting their sights on the Elves' home. *Dispose of these lycanthropes in the name of Shilen, and collect exactly 13 of their skulls and bring them to me.* This is the end of my explanation. Now you should go.
