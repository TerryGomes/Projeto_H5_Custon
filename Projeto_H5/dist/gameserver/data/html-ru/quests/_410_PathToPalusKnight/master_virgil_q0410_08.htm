!Master Virgil:

You must have exactly *13* skulls to complete the ritual. Thirteen is a holy number to we Dark Elves that follow Shilen, for it symbolizes death and rebirth.

Go back to the Neutral Zone and strike down the lycanthropes ... Come back when you have 13 skulls. Only then can the ritual be completed.
