!Kalinta:

Now you are the true owner of this *coffin of eternal rest*. The last part of the trial is to carry this coffin and go back to the one who first gave you the trial. Go to *Master Virgil in Gludio Castle Town* and give him your coffin.

I hope you will safely complete your trial and be reborn as a Knight of the deep lake. May the protection of Shilen be with you.
