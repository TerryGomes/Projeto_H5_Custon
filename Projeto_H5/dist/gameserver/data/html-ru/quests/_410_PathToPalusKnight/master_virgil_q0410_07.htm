!Master Virgil:

How does it happen that you have not departed yet? Is fear or hesitation keeping you here? If that is so, I will have to reconsider your qualifications for becoming a Palus Knight.

Hurry on to the Neutral Zone and kill the lycanthropes and bring *thirteen of their skulls*. Only then can you fulfill the custom.
