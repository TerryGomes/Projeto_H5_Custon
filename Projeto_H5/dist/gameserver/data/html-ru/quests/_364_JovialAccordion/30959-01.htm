!Musician Barbado:

Some time ago, I heard *Bard Swan* playing his mandolin. His skills are quite impressive. I wish he would play a duet with me, but for some reason, whenever he sees me he avoids me...

I hate to ask you to do this, but would you go see *Swan* and tell him that I want to play a duet with him? Of course you will be rewarded for your effort.
