Please get some black beer from *Chef Jonas* and take it to *Trader Sabrin*. *Jonas* keeps his beer in a *beer chest* and stores it in a warehouse... He becomes quite cross when asked for favors, so it would be best if you 
handled this without talking to him.

Also, go to the grocery store in the village and find a *clothes chest*. You will find it near *Trader Sonia*. Take the contents of that chest to *Guard Xaber*. Here are the keys to the two chests. Good luck!
