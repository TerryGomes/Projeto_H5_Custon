!Bard Swan:

Is this too complicated for you? Would you like for me to explain it again? Take the black beer from *Jonas*' *beer chest* located in the *warehouse* and take it to *Trader Sabrin*. Then go to the *grocery store* and take *Sonia's* event clothes from the *clothes chest* and take them to *Guard Xaber*.
