!Vice Hierarch Zenya:

Welcome, young one. Do you wish to become a strong warrior or a great adventurer? It will be difficult to achieve either without adequate experience. You must see the world, meet various people and overcome many diverse trials.

In that vein... Why don't you take a journey to Giran, the economic center of the Elmoreden continent?
