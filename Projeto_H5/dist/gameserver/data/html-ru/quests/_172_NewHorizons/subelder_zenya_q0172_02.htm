!Vice Hierarch Zenya:

Welcome, young one. Do you wish to become a strong warrior or a great adventurer? It will be difficult to achieve either without adequate experience. You must see the world, meet various people and overcome many diverse trials.

In that vein... Why don't you leave our little island and take a journey to a city on the continent, where you can encounter many races, creeds and adventures. Once you have experienced life there for a while, return here see me.

(This quest is available only Kamael characters who are level 3 or higher.)
