!Gatekeeper Tamil:

Giran is very far from here. Here's a magic scroll that allows you to use the gate of time and space.

It's a scroll called the *Scroll of Escape to the Town of Giran*. This is valuable, you can use it only *once*! Use it wisely.

I will put it in your quest item window. I'll give you a *Traveler's Mark* as well. When you wish to return to Immortal Plateau, hometown of the Orcs, take this mark and go visit *Trader Galladucci* at his boutique shop. He'll help you.

May the glory of Pa'agrio be with you!
