!Warehouse Keeper Wilfred:

As you know, there was war between Aden and Gracia. But the problem is, official trade with Gracia has since been banned, and Gracia trade ships no longer come to Talking Island. Tsk, I can't believe they would ban free trade for political reasons, it's a significant loss to businessmen like me. My business was quite profitable from my importing and selling of metals like adamantite... plus, from a military standpoint, can't they realize that not being able to produce fine quality adamantite weapons will lead to the weakening of military powers? Such a difficult situation...

Now this is our little secret, but actually, I am still trading with Gracia through *secret routes.* We may be political enemies, but that doesn't always make a difference in real life. There is always a high demand for goods from Gracia. So, what do you think? As long as you promise not to talk about this in front of anyone else, I can tell you some more...
