!Master Chef Donath:

.....%%
You've waited for a long time for this! Here's the appetizer... and the main course... and over here, the dessert!%%
Did you know that I made this food without using any fire whatsoever? I cooked it with the ice crystal! It's a very mysterious and difficult process! I'm exhausted!%%
Why aren't you eating? Do you plan to share it with someone? If so, you'd better get it where you're going quickly, before it spoils! I've heard that people like to eat this food at the* Coliseum of Aden* before a match. Is that what it's for?
