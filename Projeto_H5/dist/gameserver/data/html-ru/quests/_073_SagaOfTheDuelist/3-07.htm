!Grand Magister Valdis:

What a surprise! Maybe you are guided by the goddess!%%
You wouldn't know of that, would you? So, you're a Duelist?%%
Maybe you can meet King Van Halter someday. Alas, he is away so much he may lose his throne soon!%%
If you're a pilgrim, get the* Divine Stone of Wisdom* and bring it to me. I heard that the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos of Goddard Territory each have one. Which side will you choose?
