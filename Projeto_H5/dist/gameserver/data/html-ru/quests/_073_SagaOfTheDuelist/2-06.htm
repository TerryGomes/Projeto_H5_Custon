Iron... He was truly a master swordsman, but he never managed to become a Duelist.%%
While on his pilgrimage, he obtained a mysterious power. He was able to defeat all opponents without even breaking a sweat.%%
And then suddenly, he disappeared! From that day on, there were no more Duelists named... Grand Master Sedrick tried... He selected a few candidates whose skills were about equal to yours, and was about to name them all Duelists! I put a stop to that!%%
Now, take this Stone of Pilgrimage! You'll need it to earn the title of Duelist. Take it to the Stone of Commune south of the Ivory Tower.%%
You'll find what it truly means to be a Duelist.
