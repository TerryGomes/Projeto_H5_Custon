!Tablet of Vision:

Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. You hear the faint whisper of a woman's voice.%%
A series of visions appear... Of an ancient Sword Master named Iron who aspired to become a Duelist, and eventually sold his soul to a demon.%%
Now he stands before the monument to prevent any other Duelist from challenging his power.%%
You'll find him at the southeast corner of the Ketra Orc Outpost.
