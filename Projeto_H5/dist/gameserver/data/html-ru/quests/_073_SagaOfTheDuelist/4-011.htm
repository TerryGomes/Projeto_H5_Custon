!Kain Van Halter:

I see you're making the Pilgrimage of the Duelist!%%
I've heard that what is written on the stone tablet isn't that important! You should always try your best everytime you fight. Think of every strike as your last...%%
That sort of thinking produces miracles!%%
Well, I must be going... Here, take this last Stone of Commune. I don't need it. I'll bet you can put it to good use! Good luck!
