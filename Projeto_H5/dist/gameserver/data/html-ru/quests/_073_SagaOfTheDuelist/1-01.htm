!Master Chef Donath:

Ah, the legendary last meal of Duelists!%%
Is it for you? The last dish...%%
Did you know that dish actually contains the resolve one feels before going into mortal combat?%%
And, of course, the ingredients must be gathered by the Duelist himself. Consuming food gathered at great risk allows the warrior to absorb the power of his opponent!%%
If the meal is for you, you should collect and bring back the ingredients by yourself!
