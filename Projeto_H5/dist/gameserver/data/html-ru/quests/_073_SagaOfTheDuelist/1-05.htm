!Master Chef Donath:

First, bring me some meat! Umm... The pastureland of Rune would be a good place to start. Speak with the beast herder. Make sure you get a piece of* Top Quality Meat*! Oh, you can't just come out and ask him for it either! The guy's a real jerk! You should offer to deliver some of his meat to the village, and then steal a piece of it!%%
I'll also need an* ice crystal*. I need it to sterilize the meat and preserve it. You can get one from* Chef Jeremy*. He's nearby. He'll most likely ask you to do him a favor in exchange.%%
After you get both ingredients, bring them to me. I'll start getting ready.
