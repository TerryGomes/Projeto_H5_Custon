!Beast Herder Tunatun:

Donath said I should be expecting you. You must have had quite the journey getting here. As requested, <font color="LEVEL">Top Quality Meat</font>.

Now forgive my abruptness, but unless you have more business with me you should leave. This place is not for the aimless wanderer..
