!Master Chef Donath:

Did you bring the meat and the ice crystal? I'm going to get started. It isn't going to be easy! You can wait if you want to. Maybe you could practice your skills or something!%%
A certain amount of sacrifice by the chef is necessary, but you risked your life obtaining the ingredients, so I'll do my part!
