!Tablet of Vision:

There's a disturbance near the tablet.%%
Iron may be stronger than the warrior, but that doesn't guarantee the outcome of this battle.%%
He bears the scars of countless battles, as do I.%%
Is that the tablet, or is it an illusion? The sound of clashing swords snaps you out of your torpor.
