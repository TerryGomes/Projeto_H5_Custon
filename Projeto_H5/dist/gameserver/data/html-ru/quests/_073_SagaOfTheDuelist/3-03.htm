!Grand Magister Valdis:

Just killing won't win you a stone.%%
First, you must go to the Varka Silenos stronghold and meet with Naran Ashanuk, their messenger. He'll help you to form an alliance with them.%%
You must win their trust by proving yourself in battle.%%
Or, if you want, you can approach the Ketra Orcs.
