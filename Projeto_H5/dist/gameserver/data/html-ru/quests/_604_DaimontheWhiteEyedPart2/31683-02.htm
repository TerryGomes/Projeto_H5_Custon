!Eye of Argos:

Go to the stronghold of Daimon the White-Eyed, find the altar used to make sacrifices and place the summoning orb upon it.
One more thing!
Occasionally, Daimon hides the altar. If this happens, wait until the altar reappears before taking action. Apply all your courage and faith to destroying Daimon!
