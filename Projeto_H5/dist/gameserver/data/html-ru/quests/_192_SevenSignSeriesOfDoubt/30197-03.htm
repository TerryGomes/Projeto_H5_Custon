<font color="LEVEL">Stan?</font> He guards the <font color="LEVEL">southern entrance to Oren Castle </font>. Should be on duty right about now, as luck would have it.<br>
Mind you, he is known for spinning the odd tale. Once he told me he'd seen a giant rat scrambling through the castle kitchens, so we went down together, swords at the ready an' torches lit.<br>
Only turned out to be a stray dog didn't it? Cute little thing n all, called it Bessie. Course, then it died. Jumped out a window, it did. Stupid mutt.<br>
Anyway, enough of that. You go see Stan.
