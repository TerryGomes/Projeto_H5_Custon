I was out walking through the <font color="LEVEL">Oren Castle</font> grounds a couple of nights ago. Truth be told, I was clearing my head - women problems, see?<br>
Anyway, there I was, when it a chill creeps up my spine and everything goes deathly quiet. Suddenly this thing appears in front of me, makes some weird old sound, and... I could feel its eyes looking... looking INTO me.<br>
Then, quick as a click, it was gone.<br>
See... told you. It was nothing.<br>
