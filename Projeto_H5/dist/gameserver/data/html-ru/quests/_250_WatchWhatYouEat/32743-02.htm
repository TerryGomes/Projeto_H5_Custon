Investigator Sally:

I wish I knew, truly. I'm determined to find out...in fact, you might be able to help me, if you're willing?

Look, I have no illusions about myself. I'm no fighter. Girls could beat me up. Little girls. Little sick girls. It's not a big secret or anything, but could you maybe not repeat that to anyone?
