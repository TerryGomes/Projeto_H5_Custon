Investigator Sally:

Agh! I'm dying to learn more about the plants and fungus on the Plains of the Lizardmen! The Plains are full of so many species, some you can't find anywhere else! But I couldn't send you, as much as I want to know. You're just not strong enough yet.

(Only characters level 82 and above are allowed to take this quest.)
