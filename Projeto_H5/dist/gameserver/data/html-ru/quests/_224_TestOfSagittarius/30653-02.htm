About 10 days from now... A couple of explorers entered the wasteland area claiming that they had come to excavate the antiquities of the empirical era. I felt there was something suspicious about them, but didn't stop them. A few days later, when Hunter Brankel came to see me, I realized that I had made a mistake. They were no mere explorers but a bunch of heathens.

As you know, this wasteland area is where the castle of devil beleth used to lie in the past. I am sure that the heathens came to find the evil remains of beleth. Brankel went to the *Ant's Nest of the Wastelands* saying that he had to find out what their real purpose is. Ever since then I haven't heard from him...

I am sorry but this is all I know.
