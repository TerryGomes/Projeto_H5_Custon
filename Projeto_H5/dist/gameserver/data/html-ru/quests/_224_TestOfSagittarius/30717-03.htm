!Magister Gauen:

To reconstruct the Crescent Arrow we need the materials that I had previously mentioned. *The horns of Manasen*, *a reinforced bowstring *made by *the swamp spider*'s web, *A Mithril ring* which can be taken from the *road scavenger* and the *chitin* of *the swamp stakato*. Please hurry and get them.
