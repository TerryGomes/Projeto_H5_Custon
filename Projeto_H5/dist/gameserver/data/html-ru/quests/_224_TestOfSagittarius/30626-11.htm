!Sagittarius Hamil

Brankel was alive! Although I did meet him, he left for the south of Oren saying that he will buy some time while *Commander Kadesh* recovers himself by eating the lizardmen. Shit!... I should have followed him!

That is... The Crescent Arrow! It is the first time I have seen it since 20 years ago! Hey, take that and follow Brankel. If you kill the *leto liardmen* which Kadesh feeds on, he will eventually turn up. That is when you should kill him with that arrow.
