!Prefect Vokiyan:

This is the amulet that calls the totem spirits...!  Can this mean that those Breka Orcs are trying to revive their totem spirit which died 500 years ago?!

Perhaps they thought that by hatching the giant serpent they would be able to recall their totem spirit. But after all, they are only being taken advantage by the heathens who are trying to hatch a devil! Foolish people!

I am sure that Brankel would have tried to stop the hatching of the egg. Can it be that the rune characters are his messages? Anyway, I don't know how to read the hunter's runes. But Hamil knows it well. Take it to him. I wish you luck, Warrior!
