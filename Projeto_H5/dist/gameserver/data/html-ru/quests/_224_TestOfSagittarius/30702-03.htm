!Union President Bernard:

Sagittariuses are those who are called as the best bowmans of this kingdom. 100 years ago, when the gold dragon Windbior attacked Castle Aden, a bowman by the name of Atlanta, shot an arrow right through the dragon's eye and was given his first title as a Sagittarius. At the moment there are just 33 Sagittariuses altogether.

If you want to be recognized as the best bowman, you may take the*Test of the Sagittarius* and prove your abilities. Many hunters and bowman took the test this year as well, but they all failed. I warn you, if your skills are not good enough to shoot down a flying eagle, you'd better not give it a try, in the first place.
