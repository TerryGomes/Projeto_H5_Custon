!Magister Gauen:

I am Magister Gauen. Commander Kadesh, the Crescent Arrow... You have brought me some stories that I'll never miss. Commander Kadesh is the darest one even among the sons of Shilen. He gulps in everything, yet is always hungry. That is because he constantly grows up... This caused fear among the Gods, so they gave instructions to the Elves on how to kill Commander Kadesh.

That is *the Crescent Arrow*. This arrow was kept in the Ivory Tower since long ago, but because of an incident that happened 20 years ago it became useless. ...but if it is true what you are saying, I guess we do need the arrow...

I will restore the arrow. But it is not an easy task for sure. Most of the materials you'll be able to find in the Ivory Tower but some of the others you'll have to find it for yourself. Yes
