!Union President Bernard:

Sagittariuses are those who are called as the best bowmans of this kingdom. 100 years ago, when the gold dragon Windbior attacked Castle Aden, a bowman by the name of Atlanta, shot an arrow right through the dragon's eye and was given his first title as a Sagittarius. At the moment there are just 33 Sagittariuses altogether.

If you want to be recognized as the best bowman, you may take the*Test of the Sagittarius* and prove your abilities. Many hunters and bowman took the test this year as well, but they all failed. You must be better than good to pass the test... I heard that you had good skills but as I see it in the eyes of a Union President... You are still not good enough. Train a little more before you come back.
