!Sagittarius Hamil:

It said in the letter as follows: I am leaving for the Ant's Nest now. However, I might not be able to come back. But I will leave my traces for the next investigators...

I wish I could go and see Brankel right away, but it's more important for me to take care of the lizardmen who are threatening the village... Damn it...

So, I need you to go to the Ant's Nest in the Wastelands and investigate the area. It would be best if you could find Brankel himself, but in case you can't, at least try to look for the traces he said he would leave in his letter. The wastelands guardian *Aaron Tanford* will be waiting for you in the  *southern entrance of the Wastelands*.

Set off for the Wastelands, now! May the Saya of the winds guide your way
