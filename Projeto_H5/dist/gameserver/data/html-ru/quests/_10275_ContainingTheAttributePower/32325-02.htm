<html><body>Attribute Master Yin:<br>
My disciples and I were conducting an experiment. We hoped to derive a greater attribute power. But the sprites we were studying became...problematic. Some of the <font color="LEVEL">Sprites of Water</font> became increasingly reckless when injected with the attribute power, and they escaped from the lab.<br>
My disciples have tried to recapture them. But some of the sprites are still roaming throughout the town. Thankfully, there haven't been any reports of them causing serious harm yet. But you never know when they might turn fierce...<br>
Will you catch them for us?<br>
