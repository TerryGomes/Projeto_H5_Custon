<html><body>Attribute Master Yang:<br>
You succeeded! Thank you.<br>
I'd like to give you something as a reward, but all that I have here are my research notes about attributes. Hmm...I can give you an Attribute Ore.  It has value, so you won't regret acccepting it.<br>
Since you have completed my request twice, I'll give you 2 Ores reflecting the attribute of your choosing. Now, which ones do you want?<br>
