Do you know <font color="LEVEL">Attribute Master Yin</font> here in the Town of Aden? She is one of our regulars. Her research keeps her very busy. Of course, her constant need for ingredients also makes her one of our best customers.<br>
But I rarely see her lately... Our sales have dropped, and her absence isn't helping.<br>
The last time I saw her, she mentioned some problem she was facing, a problem she said could be resolved by a capable adventurer... I hope that happens quickly -- we need her business! But alas, I don't know how to find respectable adventurer in these parts...<br>
Do you know of one who might be willing to help us?
