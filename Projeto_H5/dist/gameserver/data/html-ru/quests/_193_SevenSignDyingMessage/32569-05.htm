!Priest Cain:

Pick it? No no--I have a supplier already, only he's a forgetful type and I fear he's just forgotten to send me the package.

I need you to visit my supplier, *Herb Collector Eric*, and bring me the herbs that he should have already gathered. He's normally found in the *Enchanted Valley*, so I'd suggest you start your search for him there.

Godspeed my friend. Be safe.
