!Priest Cain:

I see. Well then, I can only offer you my heartfelt thanks for doing far more than you were initially hired to do.

Now I'm afraid I have to ask you to do something more. You see, a memorial service cannot be performed without incense, and incense cannot be made without the full complement of herbs.

We've been burning through much incense than normal, that with all the recent deaths, and now I'm completely out of the *Deadman's Herb*. It's a key ingredient.
