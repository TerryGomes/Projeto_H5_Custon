!Sir Gustav Athebaldt:

Ha! Good! I don't trust  people who turn down money. Means they've already been paid, usually, and THAT means they aren't in my employ.

Ah yes, here. I believe this should be about right.

Now, there's much I need to tell you, but a man's ears are near useless when his stomach's empty. How about you rest up and get a good fill. Come back when you're good and ready for the next chapter in this messy, messy story, hear?
