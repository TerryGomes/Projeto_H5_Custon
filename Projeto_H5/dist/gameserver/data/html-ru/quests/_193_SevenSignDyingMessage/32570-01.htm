!Herb Collector Eric:

Now can I do for you, eh? I'm Eric, master gatherer and general do-gooder. Yessir, need something found, just come to me. Need something killed, then... go to someone else. Heh.

Oh lord... you've only gone and made me forget what I was lookin' for, haven't you? I wonder if I still have that letter on me...
