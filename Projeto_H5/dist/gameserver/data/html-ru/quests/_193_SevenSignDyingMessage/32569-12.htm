!Priest Cain:

While you were gone I did some research, by the by, and I believe the Contractor deaths have something to do with the *Seven Signs*.

As I'm sure you know, the forces of dawn wage war with the forces of dusk for control over the three Seals. I may as well tell you now; I belong to the Order of the Dawn. That's actually how I came to be in charge of this place.

You've had first-hand experiences of these murders, as well as the murderers, and I feel I would be remiss in not extending our hand to you. Help us, and we will reward you well.

[Quest _193_SevenSignDyingMessage 32569-13.htm|"I'll help you, certainly."]
