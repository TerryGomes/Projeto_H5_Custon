!Priest Cain:

Men and women come into this world screaming and crying , and leave it silent as a winter's night. Still, they each deserve a moment's pause for reflection and consideration.

You see, some walk through life and leave shallow footprints, while some leave marks as deep as trenches, and are remembered forever. I wonder which sort this Jacob fellow is... and will be.
