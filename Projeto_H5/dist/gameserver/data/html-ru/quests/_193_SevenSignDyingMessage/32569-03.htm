So then Jacob ran the errands between the Merchants of Mammon and Oren, while the man I buried yesterday was from... where was it... ah yes--Goddard.

Hmm. I will have to think on this for a while. I have heard whispers of others being killed too, but will have to speak with my associates to ascertain the rumors that have foundation, and those which do not.

So what part did you play in this act? I assume you are not family.
