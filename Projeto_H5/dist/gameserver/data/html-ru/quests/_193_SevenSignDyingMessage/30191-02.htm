!High Priest Hollint:

Good. Now as I trust you're aware, the memorial services aren't actually held here. Unfortunately our time is more often than not spent calming the masses these days, and memorial services aren't particulary good at raising spirits.

Instead we've passed those duties onto the priests of the *Service Altar near Oren's lake*. I believe *Priest Cain* is ready to receive you actually.

All you need to do is bring him Jacob's necklace...
