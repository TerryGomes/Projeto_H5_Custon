!Blueprint Seller Borodin:

Ha! I'm embarrassed to say, but that's what happened. Honestly, I need a very powerful coolant to repair such a huge cooling system... Could you please find some* ice crystals* for me? I've heard they reach a temperature of absolute zero! You can only find them in the* hot springs area* in the northern part of Goddard.* Chef Jeremy* will tell you where to find them if you help him find some soy sauce.
