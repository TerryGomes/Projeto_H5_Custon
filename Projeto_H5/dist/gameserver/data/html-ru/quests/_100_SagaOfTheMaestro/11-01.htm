!Master Tobald:

Who are you? What? You're on the pilgrimage of tablets as well, huh? Hmm! Did you feel this Stone of Commune that I found? I can't give it to you! You have no idea what I had to go through to get it!%%
Don't look so pathetic, I'll tell you where to get another one. Go to the Imperial Tomb or the Wall of Argos. At the cemetery, you must enter the* Four Sepulchers* which is farthest inside. At the Wall of Argos, go to the* Shrine of the Loyal* at the northeastern end. One more thing...
