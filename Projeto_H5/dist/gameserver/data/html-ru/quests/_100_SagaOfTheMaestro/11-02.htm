!Master Tobald:

How narrow-minded! To get your hands on the fifth Stone of Commune, you must slay the* Archon of Halisha*! Find him in the cemetery or at the Shrine of the Loyal inside the Wall of Argos.%%
At the cemetery, you must enter the Four Sepulchers, which is farthest inside. At the shrine, you must kill as many low-level beasts as you can before the Archon will appear. That's all the advice I'll give you!
