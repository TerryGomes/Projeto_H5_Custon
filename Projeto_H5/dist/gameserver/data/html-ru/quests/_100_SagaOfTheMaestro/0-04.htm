!Chief Golem Craftsman Telson:

You should meet Master Tobald first and ask him about the pilgrimage of tablets. He's probably in* Goddard Castle Town* by now. He, like his brother, tends to show up unexpectedly and then vanish just as suddenly... So, I'm not quite sure.%%
You must read the report I gave you! You'll need to know what's in it! Get going now! Good luck!
