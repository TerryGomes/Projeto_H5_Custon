Outstanding! I'll tell you how to obtain the reagents i need. Slay the evil creatures in the Tower of Insolence and the Blazing Swamp and collect reagent ingredients. Once you collect the ingredients, use the *Mixing Urn* wich is placed right here in the basement of the tower to create reagents. Take this *Mixing Manual*, which has plenty of notes i took all during my life as a reagent supplier. Read it carefully and you will find all the information you need about how to use the urn, the formulas, etc.

Ah! You will need a Mixing Stone in order to operate the urn as well... Take this one and don't lose it!

About the ingredients, you should be able to obtain them by hunting *Crendions, Hallate's Maids, Hallate's guardians, Platinum Tribe shamans and Platinum Guardian Shamans* in the Tower of Insolence. And in the Blazing Swamp, *Lava Wyrms and Hames Orc Shamans* are the creatures of choice.

You may get going now, remember we are delayed with these potions... hope to hear from you soon!
