There are some things to do to clean up Billy Haari's mess. But this is quite dangerous, that's why I need to ask a person who is reliable. So, prove yourself if you want to get with the mission.<br>
I'll even give you the authority to teleport to Stakato Nest along with profitable missions if you can prove your skill. With the authority, you can teleport to major area of Stakato Nest anytime.<br>
Will it be enough for you to take the mission?<br>
