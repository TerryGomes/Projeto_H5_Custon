<html><body>Bounty Hunter Kintaijin:<br>
As you can see, I'm a bounty hunter. And generally, I do what I do for the money. But this one is personal to me.<br>
I'm here to bring in Billy Haari for this crimes.<br>
And I almost had him ... until he ran into the Stakato's NEst. I'm good at what I do. But this place is a bit too much for even me.<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest _310_OnlyWhatRemains 32640-7.htm">"Well, good luck with that. Now what about that mission?"</a>
