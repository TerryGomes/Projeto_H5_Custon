!Lady of the Lake:

Don't you know who I am?

My mother lost everything that she loved, and her grief over the betrayal was overpowering. 
I am the child who holds hope and faith in the future. Some call me the Goddess of Water, but that title really belongs to my sister. 
My name is Eva.

I will give my trust to a mortal over my own siblings, if they recite with conviction, and believe in that new future. Can you do that?
