!Tablet of Vision:

Great knowledge rushes into your mind. You hear the sound of distant laughter.%%
A voice whispers, "Another Hero is born."%%
A lady in blue answers, "No, he's just beginning. I can't give him much power yet, but he conjured the soul himself and filled my brother's vacancy."%%
As the power of a king rises, so does the darkness surrounding him.%%
A king must know his boundaries as his power can be defeated by shadow or light.%%
A tyrant that seeks power above all else may lose his following, yet one who cowers behind the light must call upon people with greater powers than his own.%%
Speak with Grand Seer Rahorakti.
