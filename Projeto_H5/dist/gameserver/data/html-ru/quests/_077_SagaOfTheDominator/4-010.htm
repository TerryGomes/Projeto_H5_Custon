!Flame Successor Akkan:

My older sister Cardia told me long ago that she wasn't fit to be queen.%%
Now I know why! I'll never forget what I felt during those fights! I'm not sure what's coming next, but at least I know myself!%%
Take this Stone of Commune, you'll need it on your pilgrimage. Now I must return to Flame Lord Kakai. Goodbye for now!
