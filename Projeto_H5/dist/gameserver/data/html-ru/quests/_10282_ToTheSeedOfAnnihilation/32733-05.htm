Commander Kbaldir:

Like the other Seeds that have floated into Gracia, the easiest, and right now, only way to get to the Seed of Annihilation is by *flight*. You either need access to an airship or know the Aura Bird Transformation.

If you don't have an airship, the Dwarf they call *Engineer Lekon* below is who you should talk to. *Officer Tolonis* might also sell you one. As for the Aura Bird Transformation, I couldn't tell you how to learn it, I honestly don't know.
