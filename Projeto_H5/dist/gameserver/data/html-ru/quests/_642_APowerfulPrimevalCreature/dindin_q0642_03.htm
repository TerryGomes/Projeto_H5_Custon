!Dinn:

Some wise wizards call those creatures "dinosaurs." They were not created by gods of Aden that we now know.

Even as we speak, wizards are bent over their tomes studying the origin and the purpose of these mysterious dinosaurs.

And need I even mention the blacksmiths who are keenly interested in using these creatures to make powerful new weapons or durable new materials? This is an exciting time, indeed!
