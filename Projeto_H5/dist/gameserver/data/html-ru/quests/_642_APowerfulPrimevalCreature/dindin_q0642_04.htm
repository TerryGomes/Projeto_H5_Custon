!Dinn:

Wonderful! This island is filled with perils, so the wizards and Dwarven artisans studying these dinosaurs need the help of brave adventurers to collect the materials necessary to complete their work.

They asked me to recommend someone skilled enough and brave enough to handle the task. You seem a likely candidate!

Go and defeat the *Velociraptor, Pterosaur, Ornithomimus and Deinonychus* and bring back samples of their biological tissue.

For your information, one *Ancient Egg* and 150 dinosaur biological tissues can be processed as one set of samples.

You need 1 Ancient Egg and 450 dinosaur biological tissues for recipe exchange.

You will be able to find the egg while exploring the dinosaur's habitat. But be very careful! When the egg is disturbed, *the nearby dinosaurs will come running to protect it. We do not require as many eggs as biological tissue, so assess the situation carefully and do what you think is best.*

Good luck, my friend!
