!Dinn:

You don't have enough items yet.

Go and defeat the *Velociraptor, Pterosaur, Ornithomimus and Deinonychus* and bring back samples of their biological tissue.

You will be able to find the egg while exploring the dinosaurs' habitat. But be very careful! When the egg is disturbed, *the nearby dinosaurs will come running to protect it. We do not require as many eggs as biological tissue, so assess the situation carefully and do what you think is best.*
