!Magister Harne:

Oh no! Jasmine and Roselyn must both bear the responsibility for their actions this time.

Last time I only blamed Jasmine, but it's become clear that they both need to be taught a lesson!

You have a stake in this as well, my friend. You should go to Jasmine and give her this message in person!

Tell her that she's upset the Tetrarch terribly, and to keep her mouth shut! Can you do that?

And, as punishment, she should grant one of your wishes.

May the divine blessing of the Mother of the Abyss be with you always!
