!Gatekeeper Jasmine:

I'm afraid Giran may be too much for you right now. I can't send you there from here.

If you insist on going there, take this *Mark of Traveler* and *Scroll of Escape to Giran Castle Town*.

The magic scroll allows you to instantaneously travel to *Giran*, but remember, it only works once. Use it wisely. When you're read to return, take the *Mark of Traveler* to *Galladucci* at his boutique. He'll help you.

Among all the Human cities, *Giran* is, by far, the loudest and most violent. Watch your back and have a safe trip!
