!Gatekeeper Jasmine:

You don't have the money, skills or background to even think of visiting a foreign country through the gate of time and space! You must be an idiot!

Believe me, I'm telling you this for your own good! Don't embarrass yourself and your race!

You'd certainly make the same mistake that *Sentry Roselyn* made such a long time ago! Adventure and romance should be left to those who can handle it! It seemed for a while that she had learned from her grievious mistake, but recently she's been showing signs of her old reckless and foolish ways. I guess some people never learn!

You cannot travel through this gate. Anyway, according to the rules of our guild, no one may travel to Giran through this gate of time and space.
