*Jasmine*, you just wait!

I feel ashamed, but this is what happened to me a long time ago. How could she say that about her sister!

Sounds like she had some words for you, too, the condescending blabbermouth. It's time for us to correct her. Even I can't stay indifferent after hearing that.

Please take this *note* to *Magister Harne*. It has some great gossip about Jasmine he'd love to hear.
