!Gatekeeper Jasmine:

You can visit many different places through the gate of time and space. The most cosmopolitan place of all is *Giran Castle Town*!

I wasn't there for long, but I can tell you that it's a very dynamic, vibrant place. There are all sorts of people searching for adventure and romance there. The village is something of a world unto itself! You simply must visit it sometime...
