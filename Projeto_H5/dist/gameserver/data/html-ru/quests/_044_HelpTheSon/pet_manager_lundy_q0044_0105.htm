!Pet Manager Lundy:

Is this work hammer for me? Thank you! You will be blessed!

What? Money? I don't have any, silly!

By the way, I need another favor! My son went to Talking Island seeking adventure! He'll be graduating soon, and I want to send him this work hammer as a graduation present.

But there are fearsome bandits laying in wait around here. You must kill them! *Of course, I'll still need the work hammer.*
