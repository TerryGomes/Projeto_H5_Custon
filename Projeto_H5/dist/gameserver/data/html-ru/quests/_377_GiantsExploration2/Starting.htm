!Head Researcher Sobling:

Wonderful! Slay the *lesser giants* in the Cave and bring back proof that ancient *Titan Books* are there.

Here is some advice... Although you are clearly an experienced adventurer, it is much too dangerous for you to go alone. You must find fellow adventurers to accompany you. When you bring back proof, I will form an excavation team. I will give you this *Ancient Language Dictionary: Intermediate Level* in exchange for the relics you collect. Please bring back only valuable items.
