!Head Researcher Sobling:

So Cliff sent us this dictionary, i can see clearly now.
 It's very impressive...
 There are more relics for we to find out and maybe you will help us as a future member of our excavation team.
 We should look for *The book of the Titan's science, and the Book of the Titan's Culture.*

Our payment for such a discovery cannot be rejected so easily, *A grade recipes* used in the manufacture of top level armors...
 Of course i won't give you anything just for fragments, you will have to gather every piece of a given book.

[Quest _377_GiantsExploration2 yes|I will search for ancient books]
