!Head Researcher Sobling:

Excellent! You came back! Was it difficult to collect ancient books?

Hum... what is it? You have some untranslated book fragments here, but those are of no use to me until you translate its contents, i have no time to do it on my own and that's why i gave you the dictionary Cliff sent to me.
 Anyway i can check any other translated fragments you may have...
