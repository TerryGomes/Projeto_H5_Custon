Please find out what you can about a necromancer named* Hindemith* who's been seen near the Tablet of Vision. A while back he was sent to spy on the followers of Lich King Akron. Word has come to me that he has actually* allied with that wicked despot*!%%
I think Hindemith has undertaken the* Pilgrimage of the Tablets of Vision*. Join that pilgrimage and find out what he's up to.%%
First, visit* High Priest Gregory in Goddard Castle Town*. He'll tell you what to do next. Pick up a guild bulletin on your way out!
