!High Priest Gregory:

Ah, the Divine Stone of Wisdom! Good job!%%
I heard that Hindemith was seen yesterday in the Varka Silenos stronghold and the Ketra Orc advance base. He must've been looking for the Stone of Commune, too! He may be nearing the Tablet of Vision as we speak!%%
We must hurry! Shall I join these two stones together?
