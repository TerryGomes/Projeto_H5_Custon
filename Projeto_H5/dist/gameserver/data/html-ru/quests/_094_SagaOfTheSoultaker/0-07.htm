!Hardin:

I knew it! Hindemith couldn't have done such a thing! This should relieve the pressure our guild has been under, and get Hindemith out from under a cloud as well.%%
By the way, while you were doing this, you've completed your own Pilgrimage of the Tablets of Vision.%%
Henceforth you shall be known as a Soultaker! Congratulations!
