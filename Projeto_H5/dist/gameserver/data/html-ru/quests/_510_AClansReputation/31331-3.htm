!Grand Magister Valdis:

Thank you, thank you! Legend has it that these creatures are extremely vicious... Oh, but I'm sure they will pose no more trouble to such a powerful clan than a kitten with her claws! So, will you go to the Primeval Isle and slay a *Tyrannosaurus*?

*Naturally, we don't expect you personally to slay the creature.* There is no rule requiring a clan leader to brandish his own sword in these matters. *Simply stay nearby and watch your clan members slay the Tyrannosaurus and return here with its claws. It's vital that the claw be undamaged, you understand, which means...uh, well, it's probably best that you capture the creature before slaying it. I hope that doesn't complicate the task for you!*

I'll be here anxiously awaiting your good news.
