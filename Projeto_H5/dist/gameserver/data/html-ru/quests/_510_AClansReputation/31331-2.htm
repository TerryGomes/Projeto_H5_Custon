!Grand Magister Valdis:

We lack sufficient weapons and armor to properly equip the guards who safeguard us here. The local blacksmiths have agreed to manufacture what we need, but lack the necessary raw materials to do so. We have been searching for those materials, but without much success. I recently heard that the claws of the ferocious *Tyrannosaurus*, a creature that inhabits the Primeval Isle, would be ideal for our purposes.

Would you consider using the power of your clan to collect those materials for us?

If you help us, I will help you enhance your clan's prestige throughout this land by spreading word of the great feat you have accomplished for us. Well? What say you?
