!Atuba Chief Varkees:

The almighty Flame Lord has ordered me to defeat the *Rakeclaw Imps*. Have you ever encountered those disgusting creatures? They are an abomination! Spawned from the blackest magic, their very existence defiles our sacred lands.

But they are too cowardly to face us alone -- there must be someone or something else controlling them. I have pledged to the Flame Lord that I will find out the truth, no matter what!

(Only characters who are level 6 and above may undertake this quest.)
