!Atuba Chief Varkees:

The almighty Flame Lord has ordered me to wipe those disgusting *Rakeclaw Imps* from the face of the earth! Have you ever encountered those disgusting creatures? They are an abomination! Spawned from the blackest magic, their very existence defiles our sacred lands.

But they are too cowardly to face us alone -- there must be someone or something else controlling them. According to our seers, a jeweled *Soulstone* is embedded in each of their black hearts. This Soulstone enslaves its victim to the will of another.

The seers also believe that if we gather enough Soulstones, we will be able to turn their own powers against them and discover who is controlling the Imps. I therefore charge you with the task of slaying these filthy Imps and bringing me the Soulstones embedded in their hearts!
