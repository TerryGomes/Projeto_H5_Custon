!Atuba Chief Varkees:

Tejakar Pa'agrio! You have done well, young Orc. Though you have not found a Red Soulstone, the Black Soulstones you have brought will help us discover who or what is controlling these vile Imps!

As promised, I will reward you for each of the Soulstones you have brought. If you wish to continue to aid us, I will reward you further.
