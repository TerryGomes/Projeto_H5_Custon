!High Priestess Levian:

The evil spirit can be found on the *south shore of Gludio*. You must not confront *Bifrons* alone. Take comrades with you.

After slaying the evil spirit, find the weird looking chest and bring me the *mark of darkness* that is contained within. Then we will destroy that blasphemous object once and for all.
