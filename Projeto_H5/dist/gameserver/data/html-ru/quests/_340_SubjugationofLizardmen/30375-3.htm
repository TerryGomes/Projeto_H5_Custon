!Priest Adonius:

You have performed a noble deed for our temple. Now Agnes can have a funeral befitting a person of her stature.

It is all so very tragic! I know that all that happens is the will of Einhasad, still, when something so senseless happens it makes a person wonder...

Well, we must meditate upon the light and seek the truth of the Goddess.

Our struggle is bound to continue. Our temple could definitely use the services of a powerful defender such as yourself. Please go and meet with *High Priestess Levian*.
