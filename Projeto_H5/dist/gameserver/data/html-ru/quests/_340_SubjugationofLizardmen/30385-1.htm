!Guard Weisz:

Do you plan to follow the northern road on your voyage to Oren? If so, you must beware of the lizardmen. They are becoming more brazen in their atrocities.

Those filthy reptiles! It wasn't enough to burn farms and slaughter livestock, now they are looting in broad daylight! Something must be done about this outrage!

Unfortunately, our guards have their hands full with the Turek orcs and Ol Mahums... We have come to the conclusion that we have no choice but to rely on mercenaries to save us from these lizardmen. If you know any skilled ones, send them to me.

(This quest can only be undertaken by a character of level 17 or higher.)
