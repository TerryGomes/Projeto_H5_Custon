!High Priestess Levian:

The followers of Einhasad will always be subject to trials. Now is no different, as  the people of Gludio are being confronted by evil itself.

Lizardmen are reptiles. They look somewhat like dragons. They are just the lackeys of Shilen. The true evil we must confront is *evil spirit Bifrons*, who is secretly controlling the actions of the lizardmen. Please help us deal with him.
