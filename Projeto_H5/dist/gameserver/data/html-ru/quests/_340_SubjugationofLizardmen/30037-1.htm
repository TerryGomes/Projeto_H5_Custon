!High Priestess Levian:

From all accounts it seems that the lizardmen worship Bifrons as a god. I would not be surprised to discover that he was being controlled by an even higher being.

I sense a great evil on the *south shore of Gludio*. You will not be able to deal with this menace alone, you must bring your trusted comrades with you.

You must kill the evil spirit and find a weird looking chest. Inside this chest you will find the *mark of darkness*. Bring it to me. Then, together, with the power of the goddess, we will destroy that blasphemous object.
