! Holy Abyss Elcardia: 

I was looking for information about this in the book, we have found in the Library of Runes. And here I found the following inscription: "When will bypass around the monastery, and there will be a path leading to the library, you can find a special device, which moves to the cell of the prioress." So there it is written. 

We can only detect this device. We can go right now Monastery of Silence. I think BL easily figure everything out. I'll follow you. You're ready, go on a quest.
