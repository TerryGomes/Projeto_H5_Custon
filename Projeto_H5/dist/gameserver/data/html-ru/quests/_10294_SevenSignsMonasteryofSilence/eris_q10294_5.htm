! Nun Silence Eric: 

Sorry, but I do not have this book. And I can not check whether you are worthy to read it. Once the book has been divided into parts that have been stored in a warehouse guards, elected Solin and Anais. To get the book you need to pass the test at the guards, and the Rangers' Treasure. If you want, I can send you to them.
