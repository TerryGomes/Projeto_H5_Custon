!Lennunt Chief Harak:

We have waited hundreds of years for the return of the Monarch. We had faith that all Humans would submit to the army of almighty oak one day. I have been waiting so long to return the 'Scepter of Flames', which I had inherited from my father, to your majesty, Master of all Oaks ** When I heard the news that the messenger of the Monarch had come to Gludio, I crossed the sea to meet you even at the risk of my life. And still enduring all the fierce attacks from the lizard tribe, we have waited for thee--the messenger of the Monarch.

Take this. This is the scepter that we the Lennunt have treasured for 500 years.
