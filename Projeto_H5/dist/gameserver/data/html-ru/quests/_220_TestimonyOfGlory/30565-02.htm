!Paagrio Lord Kakai:

Have you recovered the seal of the Tantos tribe? With this, the wrath of the Tantos tribe's ancestral spirits will be somewhat appeased. But it is not enough to wash ourselves of our sins.

I hear that the Ragna tribe are behind this...on top of betraying us, now they directly challenge my authority! A ruthless vengeance will rain upon the betrayer tribe!

Are the seals in this box the seals you have recovered from the lesser tribes of the other regions? Surely these have been given along with a pledge of devotion, or through the deliverance of a swift punishment to those who did not obey? You have done well, Warrior of my race! I still remember when you first came to me, fresh from your training from the Paagrio temple and in utter bewilderment. You have grown up well, young Orc!

Now I will give you the *Mark of Honor*! This is a mark that symbolizes the fact that you have earned the right to rise to the advanced level! And I ask you! Return to the land of the Humans and fulfill your ambitions! The young members of our race will lead us to a new future!
