!Seer Tanapi:

Good job! At last we found the *Scepter of Tantos*, which had been stolen from the ancestors' tombs by those filthy grave robbers! The betrayers of Ragna were trying to summon the spirit of Tantos through the ceremony and harm the Lord! But thanks to you, their wicked plan failed!

I shall put the Scepter of Tantos with the other scepters of flame that you have recovered! Now, with the ceremonial box which includes the scepters, thou, young Orc shall proceed to meet  *Lord Kakai*! He will praise your achievement and contribution and grant you the Mark of Glory!
