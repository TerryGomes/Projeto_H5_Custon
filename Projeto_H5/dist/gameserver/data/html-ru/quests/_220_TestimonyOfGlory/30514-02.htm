!Prefect Vokiyan:

Did you know?! The Seers are all saying that the eternal winter is approaching! The time is close!  We must prepare for days of chaos and destruction, the endless days of war and calamity. You should also build up your power! That is how we'll be able to fight against the darkness that the Age of Chaos brings along.
