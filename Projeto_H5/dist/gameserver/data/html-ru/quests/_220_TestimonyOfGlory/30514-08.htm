!Prefect Vokiyan:

The stone shards of Manasen, the claws of the Tylant, and the teeth of the basilisk! Good! This should be enough. Now I shall grant you the *Necklace of Authority*! Agent of the Lord, go and practice orders of Lord Kakai! Hurry to go and meet *Chianta, the Chief of Dion Castle Town*! He will tell you what to do!
