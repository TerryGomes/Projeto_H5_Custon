!Gandi Chief Chianta:

Good work, Envoy of the Lord! I see you have recovered the *Scepters of the Breka, Enku, Vuku, Turek, and Lennunt tribes*! It shall not be long before all 108 Orc tribes are reunited under the Lord of Flame!

Now is the time to face the *Timak and Tamlin tribes* of the north! The last envoys I sent to them lost their heads! These tribes are savage beasts that have forgotten the most common courtesy! Fools that have forsaken the pride and identity of Orcs!

A war has been declared to bring these tribes into the fold. You must join us in battle to prove your spirit and loyalty!
