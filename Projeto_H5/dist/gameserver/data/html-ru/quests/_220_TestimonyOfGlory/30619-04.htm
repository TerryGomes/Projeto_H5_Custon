!Vuku Chief Driko:

Right now, I am facing a big problem which is a matter of life and death for our tribe! I have no interest in the glory of the old kingdom. Like the agreement between us, I will give you back your tribal scepter when you kill the *drones* among the *swamp stakatos* and bring *30 of their husks*.
