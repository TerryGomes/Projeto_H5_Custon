!Vuku Chief Driko:

Thou, oppressor of flames, how come such a noble person came to this obscure place? Did you come to see me Driko, leader of the low people?

Right now, I am facing a big problem which is a matter of life and death for our tribe! I have no interest in the glory of the old kingdom.

Unless you bring an *autograph letter by your Prefect*, which means that unless you have an urgent matter, I Driko, the leader of the lows have nothing to discuss with you anymore.
