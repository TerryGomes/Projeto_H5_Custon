!Breka Chief Voltar:

Ha!  We declared our independence 500 years ago! Now you come here and tell me that I should pledge loyalty to the King? The days when we lived as an oppressed race are long over! Go and give your King this message: I would rather be the head of the snake than the tail of the dragon!
