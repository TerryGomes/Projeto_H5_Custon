!Seer Tanapi:

Some time ago, the goblin grave robbers destroyed our ancestors' tomb and ran away with the *Scepter of Tantos*.

As you know, the Tantos tribe was executed for high treason 100 years ago. But later on, it turned out that it was a misunderstanding caused by the wicked Dwarves' mischief and the Paagrio Lord mourned bitterly his mistake. Every year we hold a memorial service to seek forgiveness from our falsely charged brothers of Tantos and comfort their souls.

If you recover the Scepter of Tantos, I am sure the Monarch will be very pleased. And the Mark of Glory will be yours for sure!
