!Gandi Chief Chianta:

*You still lack experience!* The Timak and Tamlin Orcs may be savage and uncivilized, but their strength cannot be taken lightly. Underestimate them and you will be a cold corpse on the battlefield! *Train harder!* I will not send you onto the battlefield until I feel you are ready.
