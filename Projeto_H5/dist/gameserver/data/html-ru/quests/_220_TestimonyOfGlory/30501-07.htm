!Prefect Kasman:

Take the letter that I gave you and meet the *Chief of Vuku*! If you follow the road heading north from this village, you will be able to reach *the army post of Turek Orcs*.

Keep this in mind! You are the representative of the greatest Paagrio Lord, Kakai! Always behave according to your master's pride and dignity!
