!Gandi Chief Chianta:

But *you still lack experience! *The Timak and Tamlin Orcs may be savage and uncivilized, but their strength cannot be taken lightly. Underestimate them and you will be a cold corpse on the battlefield, so *train harder*! I won't send you onto the battlefield until I feel you are ready.
