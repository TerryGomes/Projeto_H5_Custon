!Gandi Chief Chianta:

I do not expect to see you again until you have recovered the *Scepters of the Breka, Enku, Vuku, Turek, and Lennunt tribes*! This is an important first step towards reuniting the greater Orc kingdom! You must not take your duty lightly! For the whereabouts of these renegade Orcs, ask *Manakia of Giran Castle Town* and *Prefect Kasman of Gludin*.
