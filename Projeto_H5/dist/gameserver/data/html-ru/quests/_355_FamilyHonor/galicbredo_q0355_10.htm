!Antique Dealer Patrin:

Just a moment... Let me get my reading glasses...

Now, what have we here? Hmm...?!

This is indeed a *forgery* statue. It was made from the prototype. Although not as valuable as its prototype, it is highly regarded among antique dealers. It will fetch a pretty good price at any store.
