!Trader Galibredo:

Although now I'm merely a merchant, at one time my family was prominent! Although I may not look it, the blood of kings courses through my veins!

Whenever I say this, people laugh at me and think I'm lying. It's so very frustrating! But at last, now I have a chance to prove my noble heritage! All I need is a bit of help from an adventurer like yourself! I will pay you generously for your work! No cost is too great when the honor of my family is at stake! Will you help this old man?
