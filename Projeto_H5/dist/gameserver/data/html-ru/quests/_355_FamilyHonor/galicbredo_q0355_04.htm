!Trader Galibredo:

The thieves who stole my precious sculptures are the *Timak orc troop*. According to my nephew, the troop consists of *Timak orc troop archers, Timak orc troop warriors, Timak orc troop leaders and the Timak orc troop shaman*. I doubt that those brutes even know the value of what they have!

If you bring me *"Galfredo Romer's Busts"*, I will pay you handsomely. If you bring me 100 or more of them at one time, you will receive a bonus. Please try your best!

You can keep any other sculptures you recover. You can sell them to a store or give them to someone as a gift.

*They move around in a group, so it is not a bad idea to go with a couple of friends, if they wish to.* Good luck! I'm counting on you.
