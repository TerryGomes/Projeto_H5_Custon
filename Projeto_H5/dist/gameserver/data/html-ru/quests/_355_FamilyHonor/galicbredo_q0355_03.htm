Have you ever heard of Berona, a sculptor from the Elmoreden Empire? She is well-known among antique lovers...

A few months ago, hundreds of her works were excavated in Innadril. "Galfredo Romer's Bust" was one of them. He was one of my ancestors who was as an aid to the Emperor! It is recorded in my family's genealogy! If you don't belive me, I'll show it to you!

Anyway, I sent my nephew to Innadril to buy all the sculptures for me. But, while they were being delivered to me, they were stolen by orc bandits. I'm very upset with my nephew! I told him repeatedly to hire guards!

Ahem! So, here's the deal. Will you recover the sculptures for me?
