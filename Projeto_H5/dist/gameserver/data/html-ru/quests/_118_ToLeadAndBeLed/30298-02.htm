!Blacksmith Pinter

Oh, don't you worry about getting this for fee. Nothing's for nothing, you know. In fact, you will need to fetch me every single piece of material required to make it! But it'll be worth the effort, I promise you. You cant buy this kind of armor in a story.

First, you must defeat the *Maille Lizardmen* to the *south of the willage*, and bring me *10 bottles* of their *blood*. Their blood is the activator in the epoxy I use for the armor. Go, make haste!
