!Hierarch Kekropus:

If Casca has given you his approval, there's no
need for more confirmation. But this is not the
end of the process. What Casca has
acknowledged is but a fraction of your potential.
To be a Soul Breaker, proper magical control is
vital. I have prepared a ceremony to ascertain
whether you have the requisite ability to manage
your magical powers.
