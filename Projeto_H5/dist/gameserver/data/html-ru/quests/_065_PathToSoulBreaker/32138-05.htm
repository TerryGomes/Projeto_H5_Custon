!Hierarch Kekropus:

You must have felt that the magic we use if of a
fundamentally different form than the magic
used by the other races. Out power is channelled
not through songs or gestures, but through a
distinct source. To tap into it, you must be able to
feel and control the magical power within you
tha is the purpouse of this ceremony. We will
need a specific ingredient to begin, however.
Below Dragon Valley, in the Gordon's Garden,
you will find a Worm who has been weaked by
the effects of the Land Dragon Antharas. He still
harbors certain magic we need. Bring me 10 of
the Worm's hearts.
