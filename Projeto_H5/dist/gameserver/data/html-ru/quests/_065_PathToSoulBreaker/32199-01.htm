The Hierarch asked me to.. suspicious
person... don't know what to do... perhaps the man
who receives the freight information...

Hmm, if someone came from the outside, it
should've been very obvious since only we are
able to come in here. Perhaps he is one of them?
If so, he must have never been seen here in
Dion... Wait, how about that man?

Him!

Look over there!
