!Vice Hierarch Casca:

Ah, i see that you met him. This has become
more dangerous than i originally anticipated. He
was a bit late, but thankfully, the mission was
safely completed. Thank you for a job well done.
The last person that you met... I am sure you will
meet again somesay. You have proven your
abilities. Return to Hierarch Kekropus.
