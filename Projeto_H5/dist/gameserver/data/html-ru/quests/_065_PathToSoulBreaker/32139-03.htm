!Vice Hierarch Casca:

Someone that our Guild cannot identify is
wandering around asking for information about
the cargo from Gludin. He has caused no
problems yet but his behavior is very
strange. Track him down and find out who he is,
then bring the cargo here securely and safely. I
have heard that an unidentified man recently left
the Town of Gludio in the direction of the Town
of Dion. Visit the Guild in the Town of Dion first.
