!Mercenary Red Foot:

Have you ever heard of a hatchling?  It is a cute baby dragon that has been
hatched from the egg of a wyrm or a drake.  Among pet handlers, I heard that
there is someone who knows how to raise a hatchling as ones own pet  I think
his name is Cooper or something like that.  If you are interested in keeping
a hatchling as a pet, why dont you go see him!
