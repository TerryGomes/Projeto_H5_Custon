!Mercenary Red Foot:

All right, lets go ahead and open this box  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake  Here we go!  There that was too easy.  Now, lets see whats in the box.%%
Hmm?  Machine parts?  This Guild Mark seems to be that of the Black Anvil Guild what do you think?%%
Although I dont know for sure, these seem to be parts that are used by dwarves to do repair work on golems.  If you take them to a store, I think you will be able to sell them at a pretty reasonable price.%%
