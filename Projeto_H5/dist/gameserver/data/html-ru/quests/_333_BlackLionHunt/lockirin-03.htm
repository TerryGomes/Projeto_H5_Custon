!First Elder Lockirin:

Huh...?! I said I'd express my thanks abundantly but you still refuse...
Look here, young fellow. Do you really think you can sell that tablet
somewhere else at a higher price? I guarantee that no matter how hard
you look, you won't find anyone that will give you as much as I will.
If your opinion changes, please come to me again. Turn over that tablet
to me anytime and I'll give you a big gift of gratitude as I promised!
