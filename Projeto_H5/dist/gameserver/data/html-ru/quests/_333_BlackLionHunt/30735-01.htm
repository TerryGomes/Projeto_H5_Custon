!Mercenary Sophia:

All right!

The time has come for the black lions that have been crouching until now,
to bare their claws and start hunting!

Now, I will explain our combat situation. We currently have four targets of attack.
They are the Execution Ground, the Partisan Hideaway, southern shoreline area, and the Cruma Marshlands.
Since we do not have enough combat power to hold a drawn-out war,
we will dispatch a small group of soldiers as a strike force to carry out the strategy of hit
and run to drive out the evil spirits.
