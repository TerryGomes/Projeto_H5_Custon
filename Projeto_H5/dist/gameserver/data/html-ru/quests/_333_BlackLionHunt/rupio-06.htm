OK, shall I demonstrate my talents now? Well, this fragment looks like it
goes to the very bottom section of the stone tablet... And this piece is
above that... It's like putting together a puzzle... OK... It's finished!
It's an ancient stone tablet... I'm really curious whether some secrets of
history are recorded on it! Hmm... But these letters look like writing of
the titans... I've seen this somewhere before...! Where in the world could...?!
