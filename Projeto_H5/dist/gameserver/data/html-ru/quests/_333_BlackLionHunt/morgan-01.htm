!Guilde Member Morgan:

It's a freight box of our commercial guild!? It is freight that was
stolen from our carts having been attacked by evil creatures recently.
But there is a lot of freight that was looted and so our losses are really
big. Still, it is really fortunate that you could recover this part.%%As
a representative of the commercial guild, I thank you for your efforts. Here,
take this gift of gratitude, even though it's not much. And I present you with
these (*coins from our guild*). It's like a plaque of
appreciation that we give to people that have contributed to the commercial guild.
