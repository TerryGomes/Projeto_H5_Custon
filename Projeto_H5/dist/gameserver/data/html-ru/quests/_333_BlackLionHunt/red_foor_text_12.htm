!Mercenary Red Foot:

Would you like me to introduce you to a job opportunity? If you go to the northwestern area of Gludio, there is a farmer whose name is Peter.
He is currently hiring mercenaries to chase out turek orcs that have settled down near his farm  With your ability, you could deal with turek orcs with no problem, right?
By the way, did you know that relics of ancient kingdoms are often found in that area? While dealing with turek orcs, I heard that some people have discovered precious ancient relics by accident.
