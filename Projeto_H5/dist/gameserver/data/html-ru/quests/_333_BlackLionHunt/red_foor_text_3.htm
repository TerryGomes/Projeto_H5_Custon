!Mercenary Red Foot:

Some time ago, while I was talking with the members of the Dark Elf Guild,
 I found out that Dark Elves worship the Goddess Shilen!!   Are you saying
that everybody already knows about that?   Well, I heard about it for the
first time  %%
Why would you want to worship a goddess of death  It doesnt
make any sense to me.  But according to those who have been to the Dark Forest,
the Temple of Shilen built by the Dark Elves is truly magnificent.

They told me that the Abyssal Celebrants at the temple are gathering fragments
of the statue of Goddess Shilen from everywhere!
