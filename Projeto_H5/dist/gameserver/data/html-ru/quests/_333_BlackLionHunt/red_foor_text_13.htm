!Mercenary Red Foot:

Have you heard of the Aden Business Guild?  It is an association of human traders.
Since they saw that dwarven traders and warehouse keepers were generating a lot of
profit while engaging in their organizational activities, humans decided to imitate
them by forming a guild of their own.  However, it seems to me that the business
savvy of a dwarf is inborn  No matter how hard humans try, I dont think they can
keep up with dwarves.%%On top of that, adding insult to injury, evil spirits
frequently attack the guilds cargo wagons and steal their valuable goods making
the humans suffer great losses.
