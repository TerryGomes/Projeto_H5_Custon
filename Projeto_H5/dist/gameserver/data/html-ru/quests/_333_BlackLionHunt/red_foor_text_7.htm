!Mercenary Red Foot:

Hush!  Come closer to me.  Ill give you some information of great worth.
I overheard traders talking among themselves.  Some time ago, the cargo
wagon of the Aden Business Association that was traveling from Giran to
Dion had been robbed and an item of great value was stolen.  It is a gem
called the Imperial Diamond and it is a priceless gem.  Well, since it was
a gemstone that used to decorate a kings crown, it wouldnt be an ordinary
item now would it?  I wish I could have the opportunity to look at it
even once in my life time
