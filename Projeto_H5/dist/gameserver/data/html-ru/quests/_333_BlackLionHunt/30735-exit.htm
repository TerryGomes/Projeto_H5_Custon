!Mercenary Sophia:


If you really have already made up your mind, I will not hold you back any more.

Please return the Black Lion Mark.  I regret that our relationship as comrades 
will end from here on.  

Oh, take this before you go. This is the reward for your services you have earned 
until now for the mercenary troop. Wherever you go, you can use it as seed money 
to establish yourself in a new place.  Well, until the day when we draw our swords 
together again.  

Good luck brother!
