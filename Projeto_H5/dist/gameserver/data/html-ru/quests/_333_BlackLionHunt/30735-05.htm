!Mercenary Sophia:

The enemies you will have to destroy are *marsh stakatos, marsh stakato workers, marsh stakato soldiers and marsh stakato drones*. As a proof of your victory, bring me the claws of the stakatos you kill.

As always, The more proofs of victory you bring, the greater your reward will be. %%
Now, get ready for combat and leave for the Cruma Marshlands immediately. This time, make sure to teach those stakatos the fearful lesson of the Black Lion troop!
