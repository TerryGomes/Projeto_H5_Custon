!Abyssal Celebrant Undrias:

Throughout the continent this temple is the only place where the goddess Shilen is enshrined.
Due to the humans distorted religious reformation, our goddess that we worship has been misunderstood
to be a sinister being that brings death and destruction.  But we dark elves still worship Shilen as
our creator and as a goddess who is in charge of life and death.%%Unfortunately, when this place was
invaded by the allied forces of humans and elves, many sacred objects which were decorating the temple
were lost.  Especially, many statues of the goddess Shilen which were exquisitely crafted were stolen.
We the Abyssal Celebrants are willing to give a great reward to those who can recover the statues for us.
