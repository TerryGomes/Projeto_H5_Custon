!First Elder Lockirin:

I'm extremely interested in the civilization of the titans.
In particular, I'd pay any amount to hold in my hands a clay
tablet on which the titan writing is written.  If I was some
high-class person such as yourself, I might have seen such a
thing as that. They say that ancient clay tablets are often found in the Dion region...
