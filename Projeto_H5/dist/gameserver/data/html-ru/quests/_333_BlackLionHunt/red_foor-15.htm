!Mercenary Red Foot:

All right, lets go ahead and open this box  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake  Here we go!  There that was too easy.  Now, lets see whats in the box.%%
A broken tablet fragment?  Hmm  It has some incomprehensible symbols on it.%%
Is this a relic from ancient times?  If it was not a fragment but a complete tablet, this might have been a very valuable historical object.  If you can find all the fragments of the tablet, you can get them to be restored to its complete form  If
you are interested, go see *Rupio* the blacksmith.%%
He is an expert of relic restoration.
