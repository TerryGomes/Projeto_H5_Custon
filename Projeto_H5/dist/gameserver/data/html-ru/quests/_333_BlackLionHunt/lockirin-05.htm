!First Elder Lockirin:

This clay tablet... Where in the world could...?! It's just one part,
but... Maphr...!%% Look at this, young fellow! Where in the world did you find this?
If you can gather the other pieces too and assemble them into a single item,
I'll give you something great in gratitude! I promise in the name of the first
elder of the guild federation!
