!Mercenary Red Foot:

Hey brother!  Did you tell me that youre currently on active duty? I know that must be hard work! Is there anything I can help you with?%%
What kind of box is that? Oh, I know. Thats a cargo box used by traders. Since you brought it to me  I can assume that you dont have any intention of returning it to the merchant, am I right? All right. Ill open the box for you.%%
Of course, you can have the contents of the box.  Instead, Ill charge you a small fee. I think *650 adena* will be appropriate.  Think of it as the price for opening the box and for keeping my mouth shut.
