!Mercenary Red Foot:

All right, lets go ahead and open this box  Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake  Here we go!  There that was too easy.  Now, lets see whats in the box.%%
Isnt this corn meal?  Isnt this used to feed pigs?  Well, anyhow, since its not anything you can use for yourself, you should take it to the market to sell it.
