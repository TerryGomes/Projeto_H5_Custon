!Mercenary Sophia:

Dear brother.  I appreciate your hard work in carrying out the mission.
Ill give you your reward according to the number of proofs you have brought
back.%%What is that box?  It seems like you have brought back a cargo box
that belongs to a traders union.  Since there is no clause regarding the
returning of a cargo box written in our contract,  I guess we dont have
the duty to return the cargo to the traders. But, if we return it to the
traders union, perhaps they will give us some sort of reward?   If you dont
feel like helping traders, you can go see Red Foot.   He is an expert in
dealing with spoils that are hard to get rid of.
