!Mercenary Sophia:

Wait a moment.  I present to you the *mark of the
lions eye*. This is an award to recognize your distinguished
services that you have demonstrated on the battlefield.

And new supplies have been issued for you.   Since they are expendable
goods that will be useful in combat, store and guard them well!

Now, I expect you to continue to make great achievements.
