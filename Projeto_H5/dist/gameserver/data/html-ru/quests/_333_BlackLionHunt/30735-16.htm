!Mercenary Sophia:

What?!  You want to leave the Black Lion troop?  Well, I guess you must have your own reasons.
I wont ask about that  However, Ill tell you one thing  The only place for someone like
yourself who was born with the blood of a fighter is in a mercenary troop.
No matter where you go, you are destined to end up on the battlefield.%%Anyhow, if you
really want to withdraw from the mercenary troop, bear this in mind.  Upon your departure,
you will have to return the Black Lion Mark.  Also, according to your contributions of service
you have achieved so far, you will receive the proper discharge pay.
