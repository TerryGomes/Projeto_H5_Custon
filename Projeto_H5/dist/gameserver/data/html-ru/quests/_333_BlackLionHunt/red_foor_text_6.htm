!Mercenary Red Foot:

I heard that if you go near the Ivory Tower in Oren, you will find a fake alchemist.
It is said that he goes around telling people that he can make some magic potion that
will make peoples wishes come true  Many people have fallen victim to his fake potion.
But what is surprising is that once in a blue moon, after using the potion peoples wishes
actually did come true.  The problem is that this only happens very very rarely
