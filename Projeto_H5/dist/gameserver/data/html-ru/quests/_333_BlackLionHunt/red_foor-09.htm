!Mercenary Red Foot:

All right, lets go ahead and open this box  Opening a padlock like this one  is a piece of cake  Here we go!  There that was too easy.  Now, lets see whats in the box.%%
Hmm?  A silver bowl?  And a teacup?  They seem to be of pretty high quality!%%
It seems like they were made by elven artisans.  I am not interested in such exquisite items but, anyway, if you take them to a store, you should be able to sell them for a fairly good price.%%
