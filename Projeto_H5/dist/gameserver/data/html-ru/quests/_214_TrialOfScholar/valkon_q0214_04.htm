!Warehouse Keeper Valkon:

Good! You are a good fellow. Now listen to me carefully. I have heard of a very precious crystal, what was its name, yes, that's right, it is called *the Purifying Crystal*. I have heard that only one person can make it.

If you will bring me one of those, I shall gladly give you that Scripture of Knowledge.
