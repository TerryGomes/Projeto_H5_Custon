!Astrologer Creta:

My divination skills seem to be failing me lately, dark clouds cover the future of all I see. There are surely dark days ahead for the Kingdom. We must keep the faith.

I sense that you are in the midst of an important test, perhaps one that will benefit Maria?

I also sense that you have a question for me?
