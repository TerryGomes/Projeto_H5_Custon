!Blacksmith Poitan:

The Book of Knowledge? Ha! That was sold long ago.

Triff left it to cover his bar tab, but I didn't think he would pay it back so I sold it.

It was a Sage who bought it. He was a very eager buyer and paid handsomely for it. If you want the book, talk to him. I have his name here, I wrote it in the account book...

Ah! Here it is!. It was a month ago. Casian is his name. *Elder Casian*... Address... *The Wastelands*. I wonder what he is doing in a place like the Wastelands. Anyway, if you want to try to talk him out of his precious book, he is there.
