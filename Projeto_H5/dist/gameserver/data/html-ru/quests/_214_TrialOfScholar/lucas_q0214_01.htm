!Captain Lucas:

Maria's scroll... Ah yes, I have heard of its importance. We have looked everywhere and are still unable to find it. The thief must be very cunning.

It is very unusual to have no clues in a whole month! Maybe we should consult a fortune-teller...

Anyway, *please tell Maria that I am terribly sorry*. I'll do my best to apprehend this thief as soon as possible.
