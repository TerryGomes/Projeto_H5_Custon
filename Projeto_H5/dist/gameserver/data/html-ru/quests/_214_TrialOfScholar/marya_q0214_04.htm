!Maria:

I must have the scrolls in order to help you...

Lucas's mention of the fortune-teller reminds me of something... I know an astrologer who is an old friend of my family. I haven't seen her since the peasant's uprising...

Her name is *Creta the Astrologer*. You should be able to find her in *Floran Village*.

Take her this letter. I think she may be able to help us... Please.
