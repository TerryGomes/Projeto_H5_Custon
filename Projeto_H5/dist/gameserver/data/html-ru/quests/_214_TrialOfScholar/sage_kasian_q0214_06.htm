!Elder Casian:

I see that you have obtained all the materials! Good job! An old Sage like me is no good at chasing down magical creatures... Thank you very much. The copying will be finished soon. Please wait a minute...

Here we go... All done. This is truly a momentous occasion. Here, I'll give you back volumes 1, 2 and 3, and here's my 4th volume...

Hold on! What is this?
