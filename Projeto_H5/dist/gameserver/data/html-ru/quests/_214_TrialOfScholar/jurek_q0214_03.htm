!Grand Magister Jurek:

Good job! Now, take this mark and I will tell you of the monsters you must slay.

First are the *Monster Eye Destroyers*. Many of these creatures are found in the wasteland or on the Plains of Dion. You must bring me 5 Monster Eye Destroyer Skins.

Next are the *Breka Orc Shamans*. They can be easily found in Giran. Kill them and bring back 5 of their necklaces.

Last of all are the *Shackles*. I need 2 Shackle Scalps. They lurk in Dragon Valley and are quite dangerous. Lately they have been seen in the Crater of Ivory Tower. Your life will be in danger in either place, so please be careful. I'll write you a list to help you remember all of this.
