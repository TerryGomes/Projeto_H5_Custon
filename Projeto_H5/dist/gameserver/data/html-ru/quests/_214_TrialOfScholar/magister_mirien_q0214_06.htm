!Magister Mirien:

Good job. I understand that High Priest Sylvain asked you to bring back the Crystal of Purity? I am glad to see that my concerns were unjustified. Congratulations!

Now you should see *Grand Magister Jurek*. He can be found at the *Wizard Guild of Giran Castle Town*. He once was Chief Wizard of the Ivory Tower, but grew weary of the factional infighting within the Ivory Tower and quit.

Now, take this mark and go see *Jurek* in Giran Castle Town. I wish you a safe journey.
