!Elder Casian:

What is that? You have the rest of the scripture? Could it be true?

This sounds acceptable, but let me make a copy for myself. It won't take too long if we use magic instead transcribing it by hand. We will need some special materials for it, though. Would you help me gather the ingredients?
