!Grand Magister Jurek:

Let's see, *Monster Eye Destroyer Skins, Shaman Necklaces, and Shackle Scalps*. You have brought me all that I have asked of you. I thank you on behalf of the Mystics Guild of Giran! With this evidence, I should be able to prove my suspicions and find Hardin's true purpose.

As a token of my appreciation, I will give you my mark. You are more than qualified to receive this. Now return to *Mirien*.
