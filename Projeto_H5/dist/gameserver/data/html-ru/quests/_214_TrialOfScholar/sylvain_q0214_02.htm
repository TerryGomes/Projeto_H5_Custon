!High Priest Sylvain:

Carry this mark while you perform the task I have assigned you. Let us begin the purification of the execution ground. To do so, we must acquire the *Crystal of Purity*. It is a purely formed crystal.

This pure gem is not obtained easily. The only person capable of creating it is *Maria* in this village. Take this letter to her. She will tell you more about the Crystal of Purity.
