!Elder Casian:

So, you have come for the 4th volume of the Scripture of Knowledge? I understand your situation but it is not something that I can give freely. Do you have any idea of the power of these volumes?

They contain the knowledge of the Giants' technology that was thought lost for millenia! The absolute geometry... It's a pity that we can't decipher the texts since we are missing volumes 1, 2, and 3...
