!Elder Cronos:

Such a helpless child, must I do everything for you? If you are totally flummoxed I shall give you a clue. You must find *Dieter* from the *Magister's Guild in Giran*. He used to work for me... You should be able to get some advice from him. Don't waste time! Dieter will probably not want to talk to a greenhorn like you, take this mark and letter to introduce yourself!
