!Magister Mirien:

'Scholar' is a term used to describe all high level Magicians of the Ivory Tower. They are the ones we count on to research magic and make sense of the chaotic world we live in. They are also charged with educating our young...

The Scholar is qualified to teach the highest-level magic.

*The Scholar's Trial* determines if one is qualified for this responsibility. If you choose to advance your learning, you must pass this trial. However, you still look a little green to me. As the great Magician Akenias said, "Knowledge must be won."  If you think that you are ready, do not hesitate to accept the challenge.
