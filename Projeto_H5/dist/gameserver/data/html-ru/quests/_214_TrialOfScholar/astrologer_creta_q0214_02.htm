!Astrologer Creta:

How is my old friend Maria? She seems to have nothing to live for since she stopped making the Crystal of Purity.

This skill requires extensive knowledge of the coldness of the moon, and the waxing and waning of a star. I would like to help her in any way I can.

You came to me seeking information, didn't you?
