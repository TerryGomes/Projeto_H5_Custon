!Drunkard Triff:

Hiccup~ Everyone but I was confronted by Des... something?! He is an unusually cruel and deceitful Magician. Damn! Burp~!

Ever the hero, I gathered the scriptures and hid them away before he could find them. But *the third one* was lost to the forces of evil, the dastardly *Grandis*, a huge monster living in Giran. Hiccup~!

But, now all is lost, hiccup~ all my friends are dead and I'm alone... sob...

*The second book* and *the fourth book* are entrusted to *the Warehouse Keeper Valkon at Giran* and *the Blacksmith Poitan at Dion*. Hiccup~ Take my ring and meet them.

Burp~I don't feel so good.
