!Magister Mirien:

*The Test of the Scholar* is one that all Wizards must pass. Only those who possess a passion for research and humility in learning will advance to the level of high magic and knowledge.

I can tell that research is not your strong suit. Each person has their own way. Some will be Warriors, and others will search for enlightenment through spirituality. I pray that you find your own road and overcome all the obstacles that you confront along the way.

(Quest available only for Wizards or Elven Wizards above Level 35 )
