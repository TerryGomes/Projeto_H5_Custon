!Elder Cronos:

Well, yes, of course. There are 6. To tell you the truth, I know who has the other 2, and I am not inclined to get them back.

As Dieter told you, the books are meaningless unless you have all 6. This knowledge could be very dangerous if it became widespread in the world.

My book is a mere copy of the key of knowledge which the Gods used to teach the Giants the secrets of *absolute geometry*. I just transcribed this knowledge and have no intention of allowing this awkward copy loose upon the world. It must be kept from the grasp of greedy Humans and Dwarves at all costs.
