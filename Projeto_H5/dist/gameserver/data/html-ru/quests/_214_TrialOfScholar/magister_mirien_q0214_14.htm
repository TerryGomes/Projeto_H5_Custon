!Magister Mirien:

You have brought the Mark of Cronos! Did you have any problems with him? I must confess, I was somewhat concerned about you. No offense... So, please don't' be angry.

You have completed the Trial of the Scholar! Congratulations! You are approaching a higher level of knowledge and comprehension. I'll additionally give you the *Mark of Scholar*! May the Goddess bless you in the future. Goodbye.
