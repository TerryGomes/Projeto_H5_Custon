!Warehouse Keeper Raut:

What? Weren't you here looking for the Scripture of Knowledge? I have been suffering from bad dreams for the last couple of nights. Every night an old man appears and demands that I give the scripture to the person who brings this envelope. First I thought it was just a silly dream, but then it keeps recurring night after night!

Anyway, I truly apologize. Take this *Scripture of Knowledge: Volume I*. Regarding the remaining 3 volumes, I do not know. My brother said that he gave them to his friends. It was said that some strange man asked them to steal the scriptures... However my brother and his young comrades kept it for themselves. They ran all the way to this village where I now live. Afterwards they split up and took one book each, and have not been heard from since.

What do you say, would you like to meet *my brother*? He might remember something. By the way, he won't even speak to you if you don't bring him any alcohol. Here, take this wine with you. I hope you can sort it out so that I can sleep in peace.
