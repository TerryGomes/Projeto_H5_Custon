!Melody Maestro Kantabilon:

Great news! I found the musical score for a wedding march I've been searching for!

Now I can play for all the lucky couples in the world!

I need a special Echo Crystal to store this music.

Bring me *50 Silver Crystals*, and I'll fill half of them with music for you!

[Quest _431_WeddingMarch quest_accept|I'll get them.]
