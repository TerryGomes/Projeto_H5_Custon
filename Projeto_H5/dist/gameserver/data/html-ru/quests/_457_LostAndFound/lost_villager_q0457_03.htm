!Treasure Hunter Gumiel:

Guh, OK, I know I've been in this room before, because I've seen that ugly painting and smelled that stinky monk. Seriously, that one monk stinks so bad, he's become a landmark in this place for a treasure hunter like me. They say to follow your nose, but I never really took that saying seriously...

(Only characters level 82 and above can take this quest.)
