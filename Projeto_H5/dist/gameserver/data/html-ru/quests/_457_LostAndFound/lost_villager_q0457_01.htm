!Treasure Hunter Gumiel:

Ah, so my eyes do not deceive me! You are real, aren't you? And you don't look like one of those bloody monks, thank goodness. I've got a story to tell, if you'd listen. Thing isâ€¦ I'm in disguise. I snuck into this Monastery because I heard there was a great treasure here but I'm so lost I was starting to fear I'd end up hunkered down in a corner and eventually end up a bag of bones for all time.

You look like you still have your wits about you, you might be able to help me out. Could you show me the way? Please?!
