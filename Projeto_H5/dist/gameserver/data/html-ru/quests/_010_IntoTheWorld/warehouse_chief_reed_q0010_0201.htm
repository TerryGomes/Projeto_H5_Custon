!Warehouse Chief Reed:

I can't believe Balanki fell for it, you silver-tongued devil! It's a wonder that you even survived, much less kept your Adena. He must be losing his touch! Ha!

You know, I think I like you! I'm going to help you, but you must pretend to do something in return in order to keep up appearances. Balanki puts great emphasis on appearance, eh?

Did you see Priest of the Earth Gerald at the town entrance? Give this to him -- he'll love it even more than I do.

Ask him who has acquired the right to strip mine Mithril. This is a very sensitive matter, and I won't hold it against you if he doesn't answer. But this is the price for my help...
