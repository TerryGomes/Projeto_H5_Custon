Damn that Reed! He knows better than that...

Well, I suppost I'll do it since I gave you my word. Your abilities may be suspect, but your luck is certainly holding out!

I've given you a scroll called *Scroll of Escape: Giran*.  Have you ever used a Scroll of Escape? Double-click the scroll and it will take you to the village. I've been saving this one for a special occasion! This scroll allows you to go directly to Giran Castle Town, but it will only work once, so use it carefully! I know you can't wait to get to the thriving metropolis of Giran, right? Ha!

I've also given you *the Mark of the Traveler*. When you're ready to return to this village visit *Trader Galladucci at the Prestigious Items Hall*. Show him this and he'll help you return here. I pray that Maphr is always watching over you!
