Recently, our weavers' guild learned how to imbed the souls of monsters into the clothes that we make. <br>
This method allows us to make clothes that are far superior, and gives the wearer a monster-like appearance. <br>
If you can collect souls of boss monsters, I can make you a new cloak. Interested?<br>
