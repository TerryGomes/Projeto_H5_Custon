I see you have brought all five ingredients that I asked you for. Thank you for your trouble. These ingredients will make a first-class dish. Shall we begin cooking, then?

First, I slice the monster eye meat into appropriate pieces and marinate it in drevian wine... Next, we go into preparations for the steak sauce... Mix Mandragora Essence and vinegar and add thinly sliced onions...

There! It is complete. I have finished the setting and packed it, so please hurry and take it to *Magister Mirien*. And please tell me how she evaluates my cooking! This dish will most definitely receive the highest points.
