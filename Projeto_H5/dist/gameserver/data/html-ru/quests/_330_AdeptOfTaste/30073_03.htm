!Guard Jacob:

You've brought me twenty bottles of nectar. I can make a honey from this. But if I add Royal Jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a more flavorful, Golden Honey. For this, I need *ten bottles* of Royal Jelly. It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble finding it.

What do you think? Should I just create a honey from the nectar you have brought me? Or will you try to gather more Royal Jelly?
