You've brought me twenty bottles of nectar. And ten bottles of Royal Jelly to boot! I will be able to make a delicious Golden Honey from this!

Here you go. A honey so sweet that slumbering grizzly bears will awaken with a snap! Put some of this honey on freshly baked bread and eat it with a nice glass of warm milk... Ahh... Just the thought of that makes my mouth water!
