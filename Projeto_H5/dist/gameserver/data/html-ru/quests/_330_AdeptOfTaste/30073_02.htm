!Guard Jacob:

To make the honey, I need enough nectar to fill twenty bottles.

You can obtain the nectar by hunting giant bees like the *bloody bee* and the *stinger wasp.* But the stinger wasps are very large and ferocious, so be careful.

If you are lucky, you may be able to obtain something called *Royal Jelly* from worker bees are yet a week. If I add Royal Jelly to the nectar, I will be able to make a more flavorful, Golden Honey. But for that I need *10 bottles of Royal Jelly.* It is such a rare ingredient that you may have trouble finding it.
