I see you have found forty Mandragora Roots. However, the number of White Mandragora Roots is far short of forty. If you are busy, I could make regular red essence with only the roots you have brought?

Or will you go and collect more white roots? If you do, then I can make a clear Mandragora Essence that is richer and stronger in taste than regular essence.
