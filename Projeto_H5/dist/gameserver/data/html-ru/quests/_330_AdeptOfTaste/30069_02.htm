Ah! You are the one that needed monster eye meat, right? Did you say you were going to use it in cooking?

If you hunt *monster eye searchers* and *monster eye gazers* and bring their carcasses, I will prepare them for you. To obtain monster eye meat for one person, you must bring back at least *thirty carcasses.*
