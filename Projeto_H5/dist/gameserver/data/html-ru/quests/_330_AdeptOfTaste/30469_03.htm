!Jonas:

Thank you. The dish I am planning to make uses monster eye meat, which is usually used by Mystics in their research. I want to cook the monster eye meat as a steak, the way Gracian nobility like it. For that, I will need five ingredients.

I need *Mandragora Essence* to make a sauce for the steak. You can get this from *Trader Sonia.*

The salad that will accompany the steak will be made from *marsh moss,* one of Dion's delicacies. This moss only grows in the Cruma Marshlands, and its refreshing taste is truly a treat. They say that you can find the moss if you ask *Priestess Glyvka.

I plan to make the salad dressing with mustard and *honey.* You can obtain the finest honey if you ask *Guard Jacob* a favor.

I will also make a *potato dish* to accompany the steak. They say that the potatoes grown in Dion are the best in the kingdom. You can obtain them from *Grocer Pano in Floran Village.*

The main dish, the steak, will be made from *monster eye meat,* like I mentioned before. It's best that you go to *Magister Rollant* to find the monster eye meat.

Please gather these five ingredients for me. I have written them down on this list, so don't forget. A dish's flavor depends on how much care was given in gathering the ingredients. Your job is indeed an important one. Thank you.
