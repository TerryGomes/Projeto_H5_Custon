East of here, there is a camp of the ol mahums. They are indeed ferocious scoundrels. Their trainees come out to the outskirts of the camp, and I want you to get rid of them. You need not know the reason.

There will be about twenty of them. Hmm ... I would have to know whether or not you really killed all twenty. If you bring me *twenty of the jewels that the Ol mahums carry with them, I will accommodate you*. I'll give you this so you do not forget. Now, off you go!
