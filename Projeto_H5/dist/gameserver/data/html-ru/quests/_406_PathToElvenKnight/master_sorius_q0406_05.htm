!Master Sorius:

Elven Knights choose the path of the sword over archery, both of which were developed by our race for thousands of years. These days, many Elven Knights enter the Human world to practice the will of Einhasad and Eva, even though they were originally created to protect the Mother Trees from invaders.

We must test your skills to see if you have what it takes to become an Elven Knight. This is a test to judge your skills, but I am sure one of your level will pass with no particular difficulties. What do you say? Will you assume the challenge of the test?
