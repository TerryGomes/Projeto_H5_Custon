!Master Sorius:

Ah, it seems that you are still inexperienced. Just from watching your footwork and movements, I can tell that you are not ready to learn the skills I teach. Be patient and keep training. I see in your eyes that you have the passion and conviction to succeed. I will look forward to training you when you are truly ready!
