!Master Sorius:

I see you have safely passed Kluto's test. Congratulations. You have proved through this test that you have the ability to not be timid, but to show the courage of an Elven Knight. This brooch is made of materials collected by other Elves who have gone through the Test of the Elven Knight before you. Thus, we are continuing the brilliant tradition of the Elven race in the circle of fate where we receive from our ancestors and pass on to our future generations.

You can change your profession to Elven Knight when you give this brooch to *Grand Master Rains* of the Fighters Guild. Well then, until the next time we meet, may the protection of Eva be with you!
