!Warehouse Chief Ranspo:

What am I supposed to do with a sauce? I suppose I could make steak... I could prepare it Dwarf-style, and use the sauce that Jonas developed. That should be enough to satisfy the inspector.

My preparations for the feast are almost complete... I have one last favor to ask you... Can you guess what it is? Yes, the dessert! What meal is complete without a delicious dessert? Go and see *Magister Rollant at the temple*, I've heard that he has a secret recipe for a dessert made with local ingredients...
