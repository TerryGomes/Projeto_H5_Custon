!Warehouse Chief Ranspo:

Monster Eye Steak? Oh my, that is unique! I like it! I'm sure the inspector will be very impressed!

My preparations for the feast are almost complete... I have one last favor to ask... Can you guess what it is? Yes, the dessert! What meal is complete without a delicious dessert? Go and see *Magister Rollant at the temple*, I've heard that he has a secret recipe for a dessert made with local ingredients...
