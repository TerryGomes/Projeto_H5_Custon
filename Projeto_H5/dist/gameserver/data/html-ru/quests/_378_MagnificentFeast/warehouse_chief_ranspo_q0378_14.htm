His recipe for what? Salad?! You can't really expect me to serve rabbit food to the inspector! Well, actually, it is a specialty of Dion... I suppose I could give it a try...

Well... my preparations for the feast are almost complete... I have just one last favor to ask you... Can you guess what it is? Yes, the dessert! What meal is complete without a delicious dessert? Go and see *Magister Rollant at the temple*, I've heard he has a secret recipe for a dessert made with local ingredients...
