!Detention Camp Warden:

Sure! If you wish, of course. We're glad to take help from any hands now. But I must warn you...

There're 4 investigators trapped there. They're not weak, but without your help they are doomed. Pailaka is a dream, so we don't know what would happen of investigators will die. Your job is to hold *3 waves of attack* and make sure all investigators are alive.

You can't make it alone, so gather your friends and speak to me. We can't waste any moment longer!
