!Elder Spiron:

Why have you returned empty handed? Don't tell me that you've forgotten what your job is.

Given the urgency of the situation, let me tell you one more time! Your job is to punish the insolent goblins that are interrupting our guild's trade. *Defeat the goblins and bring their necklaces as proof.* I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces that you bring.

Now! Leave at once! Time is money!
