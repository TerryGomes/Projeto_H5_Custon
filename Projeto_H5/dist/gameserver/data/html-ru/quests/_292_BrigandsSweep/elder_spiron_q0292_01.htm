!Elder Spiron:

Business is bad these days because of the *goblin brigands*. The goblins have become so bold that they attack freight wagons now!

Just last week, a wagon belonging to our guild was attacked by the goblin brigands. I am thinking of addressing this brigand issue next month at the Guild Association Elder Council ... But I can't wait that long ... I need to do something about this ...
