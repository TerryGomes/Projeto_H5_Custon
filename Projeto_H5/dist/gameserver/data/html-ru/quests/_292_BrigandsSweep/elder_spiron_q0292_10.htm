!Elder Spiron:

Well done! As promised, I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces you have brought after killing the goblins. Their spirits must be significantly deflated!

What is this, a contract ...? This is the suspicious memos all combined! Let me see ... Hmm ... Yes ... As I thought ...*The goblins were hired by the Silver Scale Guild.* I can't believe Balanki would hatch such a bold plot ... Well, I must do something!

Going straight to the Guild Elder Council is not much fun ... I think meeting Balanki and coming to a mutual agreement is better! I finally have his weak point ... He must pay a high price for his actions!

Thanks to you, I have obtained valuable information. Since I am a fair Dwarf, I will reward you additionally for your unexpected achievement. Many thanks for your troubles!
