!Elder Spiron:

Well done! As promised, I will reward you based on the number and type of necklaces you have brought after killing the goblins. Have you found the rest of the suspicious memos?

Please help me out once more, my friend! You know that you are the only one I can trust. I must find the rest of the memos and find out who is trying to destroy our Guild!
