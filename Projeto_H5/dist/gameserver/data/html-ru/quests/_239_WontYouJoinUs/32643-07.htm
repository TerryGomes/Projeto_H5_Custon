!Priestess Athenia:

Hmm.... you've done better than I thought you would. But I'm not sure if I trust you yet. Do one more thing for me, and my confidence in you will never be in question again.

Return to the Fields of Silence and defeat the *Suppressors* and *Exterminators* that you encounter there.
 Bring me back *20 Enchanted Golem Fragments* and your place amongst us will be secured.
