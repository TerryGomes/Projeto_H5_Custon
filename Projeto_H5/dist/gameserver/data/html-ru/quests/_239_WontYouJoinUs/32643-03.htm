!Priestess Athenia:

To the north of us lies the Helvetica Development Base. Surrounding this you'll find *Waste Landfill Machines*.

Besides being detrimental to the environment, these machines also have something to do with the Mucrokians.
 However, at this point, we are unsure about the correlation between the two.
 All we know is that these machines stand in the way or our purpose.
 We can't possibly hope to restore this wonderous land until they have been destroyed.

Please do your part and destroy *10 Waste Landfill Machines*. Bring back 10 pieces from these contraptions as proof of the deed.
