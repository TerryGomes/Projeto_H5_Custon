!Lilith:

It has been over a hundred years since I came to this island. That is not a long time for us Elves, who live nearly eternal lives, but it is a long time for Humans. And it's been enough time for me to become fond of this island. This place is now home to me, but I sometimes think of the memories of my days in the Elven Forest.

Perhaps it is because my health is not good lately, but sometimes old memories come back to sadden me. The memories of a parted lover, of a love forged a thousand years ago...
