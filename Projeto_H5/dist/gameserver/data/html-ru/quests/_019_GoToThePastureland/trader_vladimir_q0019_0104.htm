You? Fine! Here is the meat! This is the kind of meat that rotten *Pasture Manager Tunatun* sent me!

Man, the more I think about it, the angrier I get! No matter what he says, tell him that I don't care! I'm never going to do business with him again!

Even if he tries to give me money, I won't accept it! Take care of it!
