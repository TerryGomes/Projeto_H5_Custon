Hmm... experiments concerning the life force... To think that a Cruma may still exist! We must find it. I'm sure that *Priest Shegfield, the Elven priest for the Town of Dion*, knows more about this matter. I'm sorry to impose on you further, but I'm reluctant to leave here right now. Would you seek out Shegfield and question him?
