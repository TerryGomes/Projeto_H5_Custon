!Dwarf Explorer Droph:

There is a Raid Monster named <font color="LEVEL">Hekaton Prime</font> in the deep substratum of this Giants' Cave. In fact, it is the central core that controls this area!

If we can expel it, our exploration will be much easier. Doing so is beyond my power, though.

Perhaps you have some equally powerful friends who would be willing to help you do it? I'll happily pay you for your work!
