!Dwarf Adventurer Droph:

Good decision! I'll fill you in on the information then, aye?

This Hekaton Prime does not show itself often: it's a controling unit that prefers to work at the back, see? He has three monsters... that's <font color="LEVEL">Gorgos, the Last Titan Utenes, and Giant Marpanak</font>, and each guard Hekaton Prime's cave.

To capture Hekaton Prime, you need to take care of the three monsters first. Capture these monsters and collect the <font color="LEVEL">Cave Exploration Text</font>1 to 3. I'll then translate them and summon Hekaton Prime for you.
