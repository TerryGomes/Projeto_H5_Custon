!Priest Adonius:

It is not easy for you to abandon the path of evil, since you have followed it for so long. If you are ready, *go to the Ruins of Despair and kill the departed souls that are trapped in the form of skeletons, and bring back ten of their bone pieces.* This is the atonement ritual given unto you ...

I do hope you are able to abandon the dark and accept the truth of light.
