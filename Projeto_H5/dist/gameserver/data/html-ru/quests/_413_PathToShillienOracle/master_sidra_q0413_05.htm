!Magister Sidra:

Good. You have sufficient experience and skill to take the test. Above all, I feel your thirst for enlightenment and power. To step into the ranks of the Shillien Oracle, you must pass *two customary tasks*. This will be an opportunity to prove that you have the courage not to fear darkness and the will not to turn your eyes from the light.
