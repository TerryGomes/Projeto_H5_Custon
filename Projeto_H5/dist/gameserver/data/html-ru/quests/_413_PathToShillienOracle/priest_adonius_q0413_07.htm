!Priest Adonius:

Welcome, child of the light. The bone pieces of the departed souls that you have brought back will be given a proper funeral. This completes your atonement. Now you are ready to follow the path of light.

Take this. It is *Andariel's book*, the book you were looking for. It is a very precious book that contains parts of the song of creation sung by Einhasad, the god of light. May you always meditate on the creed of light within.
