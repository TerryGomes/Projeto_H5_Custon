!Magister Sidra:

The two documents you hold in your hands contain parts of the song of creation sung by the Gods in the beginning. I trust that you discovered the power of the precious phrases and the truth of authority as you read them one by one.

Now I am giving you the *Orb of Abyss.* With this, you have earned the qualification to become a Shillien Oracle. Take the Orb of Abyss and go to a Grand Master to request a change of occupation. If you speak to *Grand Master Tobias* over there, you can change profession right now.
