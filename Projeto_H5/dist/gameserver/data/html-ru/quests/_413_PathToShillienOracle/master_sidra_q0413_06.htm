!Magister Sidra:

Before you become a Shillien Oracle that seeks the truth of all light and darkness, you must find the fragments of song that Gran Kain and Einhasad sang in the beginning.

You must find two documents that have the song verses of creation written in ancient runes -- one is *Garmiel's Book* and the other is *Andariel's Book*.

Meet *Magister Talbot in Gludin* to learn about Garmiel's Book. Show him this letter and he will welcome you since it is I who sent you.
