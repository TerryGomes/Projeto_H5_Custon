!Priest Kanis:

*Galate* requested a sample of the manufactured crystal that can only be made by the priests of the Crystal Oracle.

The manufactured crystal sample seems to be one of the special ingredients that she needs.

Since you also seem to be interested in Hellbound Island, I am sure that if you deliver this manufactured crystal sample to *Galate* and ask her about the method for reaching Hellbound Island, she will help you.
