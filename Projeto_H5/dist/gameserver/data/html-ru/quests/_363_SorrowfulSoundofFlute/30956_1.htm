!Musician Nanarin:

I must  admit  that  his  broad  shoulders  take my breath  away, and  that lovely  beard  of  his  captured  my  soul :

What can  I do? I've  never  felt this way  before:  Could you please  help me?  

[Quest _363_SorrowfulSoundofFlute 30956_2.htm|"I will help you."] 

Could you  perhaps find  out what would make  him happy? I love Barbado:  Please ask his  friends  what he wants  the most. Start with the Dwarves  in the  village, and don't  you dare mention  my name!  

Will you please  do  this for me?
