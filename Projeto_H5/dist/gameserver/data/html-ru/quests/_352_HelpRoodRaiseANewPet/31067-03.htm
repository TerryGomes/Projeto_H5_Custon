!Pet Manager Rood:

Lienrik are quite headstrong and hard to tame.

The training must begin while it's still a baby. However, stealing one if its eggs is almost impossible. The mother of the species puts up a desperate fight, and even if you succeed in catching one, there's no guarantee that you can train it. It's not profitable at all for now. Not at all!

If I could get one of its eggs, at least I could try my best to train it. Wouldn't the ladies in town be impressed if I showed up with a tamed lienrik?
