!Pet Manager Rood:

Oh, are you serious? I had a feeling that today was going to be my lucky day! Let me tell you more about lienriks.

They are mainly found in the *Field of Silence. They are of two kinds of lienriks: the lienrik and the lienrik lad*. One launches a remote attack while the other spits poison. Be careful of the ones that spit. They will get you if you get too close.

They both produce *eggs*. Their gender is obvious even while in egg form. Females are quite rare and hard to find.

I am but a humble pet manager, but if you bring one to me, I'll give you a reward. One egg doesn't guarantee success, so the more you can bring me, the better.

If everything works out, I might have a grown lienrik for you when we are done.
