!Pet Manager Rood:

Beauty is only the beginning! It's so light you can wrap it around your arm or let it sit on your shoulder. Its combat capability is quite extraordinary!

It can fly high in the sky and launch a remote attack! This makes it the best possible pet for the upper class! Alas, there is one flaw.
