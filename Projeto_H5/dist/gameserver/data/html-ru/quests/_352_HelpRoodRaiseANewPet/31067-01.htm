!Pet Manager Rood:

Have you ever seen a lienrik? It inhabits the Field of Silence. It's so cute... you wouldn't have forgotten it! Don't you want to catch one and take it home?

Since it flies in the air, it never gets dirty. And its coloring is spectacular! When you stroke it, it feels cool and moist... A most incredibly pleasant sensation, if you know what I mean...

Those fools who like warm and fuzzy animals don't know what they're missing. The lienrik possesses true beauty and diginity...
