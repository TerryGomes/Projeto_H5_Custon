Well, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to tell you the story...%%
 In the past, I made a Shaved Ice dessert for my granddaughter, and she loved it very much, but the ingredients are quite rare! The rarest and most important of the ingredients are ice crystals.%%
The last time I got some, I had to trade Chef Jeremy some other very rare ingredients for them.%%
Can you please bring me some of those crystals?%%
You should be able to get some from Chef Jeremy in the hot springs area if you help him make some soy sauce.
