Sagittarius's bow was stolen?%%
A few days ago someone was asking about The Bow.%%
What? You want me to tell you about him for free?%%
You want me to starve?%%
Hahaha...%%
Well I don't want to get any this time.%%
Since you're in the union, it won't cost you money.%%
Hmm%%
...%%
I know. I'm embarrassed to admit it.%%
However, I have a crush on Lilly, my partner Mist's granddaughter! I'll tell you more if you find out what Lilly likes and bring it to me!%%
I'll give you a hint: Mist knows everything about Lilly!%%
Don't tell him what I said! You shoud find the way by yourself! You'll find them in the hot springs area!
