!Neruga Chief Tantus:

*You must collect seventy fangs of the darkwing bats.* That's the only way to complete the protection shield that will keep the bats from approaching. As long as the darkwing bats become the eyes and ears of Varangka, he can see every move that we make. We cannot defeat him until we blind him.

You must be careful when hunting darkwing bats. Trackers sent by Varangka may attack you. Make sure you are always on your guard. Good luck!
