!Sentinel Starden:

I am one of the warriors who fought in the

underground dungeon battle during the war with the Dark Elves. My long time friend and companion, Rumiel, was killed in that battle. Not only was he an excellent warrior, but he was also a marvelous poet. Sadly, the beautiful poetry he wrote on the battlefield was lost during the last battle in the underground dungeons.

One day I plan to go to the abandoned dungeon and recover my friend's legacy. It would be nice if you could help.
