!Sentinel Starden:

Thank you. Go to the *Elven Underground Fortress* and find the remaining four scrolls. I have discovered his second poem already. What you must find are the scrolls containing his first, third, fourth and fifth poems. I think that the foolish *baraq orcs* that live in the ruins may have mistaken Rumiel's scrolls for magic scrolls and hidden them.

I implore you! I am certain that the cultural wealth of our race will become richer with the recovery of Rumiel's poems.
