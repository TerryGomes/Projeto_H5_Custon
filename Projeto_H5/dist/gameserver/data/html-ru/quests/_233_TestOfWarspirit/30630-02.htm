!Orim of the Shadow:

You are indeed one of the Orcs... So straight forward... That is right. The remains of Braki who you Oaks worship as your hero, is in my hands.

I bet that you will take it from me anyway, even though I resist to give it to you. I am well aware of the Oak's great power. To tell the truth, I don't want to fight you. This is not showing off, so don't take me wrong, but if we fight, I'm telling you, it is not likely that you will survive, either. Therefore, let's prevent from getting involved in a fight which is damaging for both of us.

As you know, the remains of Braki is powerful fetish filled with strong magic. If you can find me a thing that has equal magical power, I shall gladly give you your hero's remains. Don't you think it is reasonable enough?
