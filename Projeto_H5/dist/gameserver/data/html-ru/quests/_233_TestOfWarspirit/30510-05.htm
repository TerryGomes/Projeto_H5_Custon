!Seer Somak:

To pass the test, you must first find the bones of the ancestors who passed away while fighting in a war! Then through a trial thou can win over the power of the spirits to your side!

This place, the kingdom of Aden, is a place where numerous Orc warriors fought and bled! However, now it is a territory where Humans reign, and our glorious history is gradually being forgotten! Isn't it reasonable for us to celebrate the victory we achieved in this land, and collect the remains and place them on the Immortal Plateau!

I, seer Somak investigated the biography of our tribe, which was handed down from mouth to mouth, and found out about 4 warriors. Braki the clever, Kiruna the brave, Toner the super, and Hermort the indomitable! When you find the bones of all 4, bring them to me!
