!Seer Racoy:

What a pity! Our great ancestor's body has been ripped into pieces by some mere ants! I cannot bring anymore shame to the remains of the dead! Give me the bones of Kiruna. I , Seer Racoy, shall shroud the dead body into a decent shape according to our funeral traditions.

...now, young shaman, take these bones with solemnity. Have courtesy while carrying it. Always remember, no matter what road you shall take in the future. The fighting sprits of the great heroine! The glory of our forefathers who fought for our tribe!
