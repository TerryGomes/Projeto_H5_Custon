!Seer Pekiron:

It's tragic! I can't believe they damaged the body so badly by splitting them into pieces! Give me the bones. I shall readjust them into a well-preserved shape!

Young sorcerer, thou shall contemplate solemnly when carrying back the bones!  The high spirits of the great hero! The glory of our forefathers who fought for our tribe!
