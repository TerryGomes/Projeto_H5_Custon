!Orim of the Shadow:

Like it is said in the document, I will give you Braki's remains if you find me the materials that I asked for.

I will repeat one more time, just to make sure. The things that I need are porta eyes, excuro scales, and mordeo talons. Ten of each is what I need. You can find them all in the Cruma Tower.
