!Priestess Vyvyan:

It is said that the grave of Kiruna was built in the wasteland area. But that was a thousand years ago, so it might have disappeared already. Take the letter that I gave you to Salient who lives in the southern border of the Wasteland. He knows the area well, so he will be able to give you some help.
