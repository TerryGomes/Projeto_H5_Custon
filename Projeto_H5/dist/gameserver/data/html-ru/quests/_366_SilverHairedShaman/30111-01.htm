!Magister Dieter:

Have you ever been to *Devil's Isle*? It is the home of the devil Zaken. Of course he is not alone. There are all manner of nasty beasts there with him.

Deep in the interior of the island you will find *living dolls with silvery hair* that seems to be bathed in perpetual moonlight. Their hair intrigues me. I must get my hands on some of that magical stuff! The legendary power of just a few strands... Oh, well. Enough of my ramblings.

Will you do it? Will you bring back some of their hair for me? You will be handsomely rewarded!
