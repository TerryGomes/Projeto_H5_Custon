Thank you so much for granting my request. Now please listen carefully to my account.

The *Elven Ruins* here on Talking Island used to be a place where the Elves taught the Humans magic a long time ago. They say that underground, there used to be a temple where the Elves performed sacrificial rites to the spirit kings of fire and water. When the Elves left the island, they broke the *elemental Stone of Fire* and *elemental stone of ice*, which were in the underground temple before they left.

But as the stones were shattered, the magic that was emitted from the shards summoned water spirit undines and flame spirit salamanders. Therefore, underneath the Elven Ruins there are still many salamanders and undines that have *Flame Shards*, fragments of the elemental Stone of Fire, and *Ice Shards*, fragments of the elemental Stone of Water, in their bodies.

What you must do is go to the Elven Ruins and bring the fragments of elemental stones that are inside the bodies of the *salamanders* and *undines*. I will compensate you according to the number of jewels that you bring back.
