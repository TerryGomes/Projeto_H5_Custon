!Trader Katerina:

You have not brought any fragments of elemental stone. As I already told you, you must go to the *underground Elven Ruins* to find the fragments of elemental stone. Inside the fire spirit *salamanders* and water spirit *undines*, you will be able to find the *Flame Shard* and *Ice Shard*, respectively, fragments of the elemental stones of fire and water.
