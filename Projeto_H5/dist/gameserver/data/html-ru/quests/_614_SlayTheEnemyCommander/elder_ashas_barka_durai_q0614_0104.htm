!Chief Ashas Varka Durai:

Are you ready? You've already defeated Hekaton, hero of the Ketra, you should be able to defeat Tayre as well!

Tayre is the commander of Ketra forces. He's a typical savage, little more than a beast! He has cruelly massacred hundreds of Varka soldiers! He must be stopped! Kill Tayre, cut off his head and bring it to me!

Bear this in mind! Commander Tayre is every bit as powerful as Hekaton! You're strong but you can't fight him alone! Take some friends with you!
