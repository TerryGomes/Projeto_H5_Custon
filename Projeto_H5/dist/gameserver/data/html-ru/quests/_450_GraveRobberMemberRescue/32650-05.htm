<html><body>Grave Robber Leader Kanemika:<br>
We can't do anything for the ones who are already possessed by the evil spirits. But there are still some who have escaped their influence. <br>
If you see any normal <font color="LEVEL">Grave Robber Warriors</font> roaming through the mine, tell them to hide in a safe place. Bring me <font color="LEVEL">10 Evidence of Migration</font> as proof that you were able to persuade them and I'll reward you handsomely.<br>
Kuk, but know this: those who are possessed will probably attack you... If that happens, do what you have to do...
