<html><body>Grave Robber Leader Kanemika:<br>
One day, a Dwarf came to see me. I could not see his face because he was wearing a scarf but...he promised to give me a good sum of Adena if I found something hidden in this mine. <br>
But he fooled us! We just did what he told us to do, but then evil spirits spread out to every corner of the mine. Gak! Now my followers have been driven mad. <br>
Would you help me save my followers?<br>
