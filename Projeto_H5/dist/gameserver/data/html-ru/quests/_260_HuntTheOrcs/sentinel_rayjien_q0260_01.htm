!Sentinel Rayen:

The orcs of Fog Mountains are becoming bolder and bolder lately. Before, they wouldn't dare set foot into the Elven Forest,and now they dare to come into the village.

Pretty soon, we plan to recruit brave brothers to help us defeat these fearless invaders. I hope you will take part in this when the time comes.
