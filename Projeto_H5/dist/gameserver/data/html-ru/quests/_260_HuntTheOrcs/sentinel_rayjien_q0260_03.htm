!Sentinel Rayen:

Now go into the Elven Forest and fight the kaboo orcs. But you must keep this in mind. A hierarchy exists within the orcs, and because fighter or leader levels are stronger than lesser orcs, you may be in trouble if you do not take care.

The lesser orcs carry *feather amulets*, while the high level orcs wear *necklaces made from bones*. Gather these items as proof and bring them to me.

May the goddess guide your blade and arrows! Teach those orcs a stern lesson that they should never even think of setting foot into the Elven Forest!
