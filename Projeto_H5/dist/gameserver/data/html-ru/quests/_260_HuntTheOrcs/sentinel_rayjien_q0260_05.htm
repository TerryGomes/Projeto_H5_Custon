!Sentinel Rayen:

You have fought well for the brothers of the forest. I will give you a reward for each piece of proof you have brought from slaying kaboo orcs in the battlefield. I am giving this in the name of our Hierarch Asterios, so please do not refuse our gift.

Now! Shall you go back to the battlefield and fight once more? Or do you wish to stop? Even if you say that you are exhausted in mind and body, I will not fault or scold you.
