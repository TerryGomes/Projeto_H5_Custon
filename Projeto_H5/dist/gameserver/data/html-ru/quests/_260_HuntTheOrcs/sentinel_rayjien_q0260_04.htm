!Sentinel Rayen:

Why have you come back so soon? Even as we speak, our beautiful woods are being invaded by the Orcs. They are a race that does not know about beauty or purity. We cannot let them violate our home, can we?

But even if you say that your mind and body are tired, I will not fault or scold you. Sheath your blade at once and take shelter under the shade of the Mother Tree.
