!Warehouse Keeper Collette:

Ahh ... As I thought. You are a kindhearted person. This is a letter I wrote to my family. Take it. There is no need for you to travel all the way to the northern lands of the *Dwarven Kingdom*. Just deliver this to *Haprock*, a Dwarf in the *town of Gludio*. He will send my letter along on the coach that goes to my hometown. He will pay you as well. He is a generous person, and will reward you handsomely.
