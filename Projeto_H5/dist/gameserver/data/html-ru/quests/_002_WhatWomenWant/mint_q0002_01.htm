!Gatekeeper Mirabel:

Again!? Sigh... Every year around this time, some poor soul always seems to fall head-over-heels for sister. But what does any of this have to do with me? I have no idea what my sister thinks of Arujien or anyone else; from what I can tell, her heart has never been warmed by thoughts of love and romance.

Perhaps I'm mistaken, though -- Greenis and I have never been particularly close, and I'm probably the last person she would confide in. Perhaps my Uncle *Herbiel* would know more. He raised us like his own children, after all.
