Thank you! I won't forget your kindness.

Obviously, I can't approach Greenis directly -- what would people say! -- but she has a younger sister, *Gatekeeper Mirabel*. She will know Greenis' heart, and she can be trusted to be discreet. Take this letter to Mirabel and return to me with her answer.

My happiness depends on you!
