!Arujien:

Have you ever been in love? Have you ever felt your heart leap at the sight of your beloved, or your pulse race at the sound of her voice? I can think of nothing else; I cannot eat or sleep or even work!

But I lack the courage to confess my feelings, so I suffer in silence. But I must know! I have decided to pour my heart out to her in a letter, but who will deliver it for me? It must be someone trustworthy -- this is too important to entrust to just anyone!

(Only Elves and Humans who are at least level 2 may undertake this quest.)
