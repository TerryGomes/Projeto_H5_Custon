So Mirabel said to ask *Trader Herbiel*? He is Greenis' uncle, of course, but it would be awkward for me to approach him on so...sensitive...a subject. But if Mirabel thinks he can help... Perhaps you would be willing to speak with him for me? Please show him my letter, then hurry back and give me his advice!
