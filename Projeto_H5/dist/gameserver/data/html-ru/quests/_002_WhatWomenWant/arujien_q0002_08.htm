Eva be praised! I want to shout my happiness to the whole forest! I have one more favor to ask of you, my friend. I've written a *book of poems* to give Greenis, but now I find myself a little embarrassed to deliver it in person. Some of the poems are rather...intimate. Perhaps you could take it to her and come tell me her reaction? Whatever Herbiel says, I must hear it from her lips before I can fully believe it...
