Greetings, and welcome! We are the followers of Pa'agrio, as we are fated to be. Are you free to help us?

This is the graveyard of a lost tribe, but grave robbers seek to plunder the burial grounds within. And thus, the spirits of the dead have become restless.

We have decided to drive the grave robbers from this place, but we're short of capable hands and need your help. Can you help us?
