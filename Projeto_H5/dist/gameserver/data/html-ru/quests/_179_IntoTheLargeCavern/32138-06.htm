!Hierarch Kekropus:

I am glad to hear you say so. N is in the furthest recesses of the Nornil's Garden, within the large cave. As I told you before, now that you have been acknowledged by N, you may enter the Nornil's Garden and take your comrades, whether or not they have been personally acknowledged. It would be safest for you to go with a group if possible.

Once you have penetrated to the deepest corner of the Nornil's Garden, you must defeat the one you find there and obtain a key that opens the entrance to the cave. There you will find 3 doors blocking your way. If you open all 3 doors, you will be able to meet N. You will need a password to open the Door of the Past, the Door of the Present and the Door of the Future. But do not be anxious! It is the same password as the one you used to communicate before.

Do you have any questions?
