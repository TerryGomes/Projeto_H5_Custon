My mother's mother's mother made this wine for the soldiers fighting in the war. They say that when the soldiers drank it, it so raised their fighting spirit that they won the battle. Believe it or not!

In any case, I'd like to pay you for your work, but I'm afraid that I don't have any money with me at the moment. I know it's a bit of trouble, but if you visit Warehouse Keeper Lietta in Goddard Castle Town and tell her that I sent you, she'll give you what you deserve.
