<html><body>Daichir, Priest of Earth:<br>
You made it back safely, thanks be to Maphr! The magical shield in the Mithril Mine seems to have been stabilized... at least for now.<br>
Thank you for your help! Here is the reward I promised -- use it well. I fear this positive change is only temporary, though, so I hope you will help us if the shield begins to weaken again.<br>
Until then, may Maphr shield you from all harm!<br1>
