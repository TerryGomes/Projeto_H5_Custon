!Nerupa:

Recently, one of your kind who lives in the village visited me and asked me to get some silvery spider silks for him. My arachne sisters are wandering the forests and gathering the spider webs that the silver spiders have spun. When the collecting is finished, I'd like you to take them to the village. I hate going into the village.
