!Nerupa:

Recently, one of your kind who lives in the village visited me and asked me to get some *silvery spider silks* for him. My sisters have combed the forest and collected spider webs spun by silver spiders. But I detest going into the village. I would like it if you could deliver them for me instead. Would you do that for me?
