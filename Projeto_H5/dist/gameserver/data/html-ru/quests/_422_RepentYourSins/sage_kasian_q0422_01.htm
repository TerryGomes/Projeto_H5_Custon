!Sage Casian:

Why would you want to help me? Someone up there must like me.
Things keep happening that give me the impression that my penance is being watched over. %%
So, will you do me a favor? I am researching different ways that this polluted Wasteland can be
restored to its previous, verdant state. The most promising method is a potion I've been working on.
To make this potion I must secure the heart of a *tyrant kingpin*.
This could very well be above your abilities, but if you bring me the *
heart of a tyrant kingpin* my research can continue. You will find the beasts in the
*western part of the Wasteland*.
