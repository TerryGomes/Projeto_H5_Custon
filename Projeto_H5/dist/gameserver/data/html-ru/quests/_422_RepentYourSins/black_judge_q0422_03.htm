!Black Judge:

Very well, the test can begin. You must go and see *Katari*, a Dark Elf.%%
She teaches the word of Einhasad to godless heathens, such as the ol mahums... She needs your help.%%
Meet her at the *edge of the Dark Elven Forest north of the Marshland* and offer her your help. Come back to see us after you complete this task.
