!Magister Joan:

Greetings! I look forward to working with you. I am Magister Joan. I am researching the neutralization of the toxic element found in Sea of Spores. I am sure you are familiar with that poisonous pond... Your task will be to collect three *Trisalim's Venom Sacs*. You will find them in the *Sea of Spores.* Please bring them to me as soon as possible.
