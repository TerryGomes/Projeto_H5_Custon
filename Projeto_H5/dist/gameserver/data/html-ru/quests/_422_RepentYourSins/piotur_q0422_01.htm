!Piotur:

Are you here to hunt the *Turek war hounds*?
A while back a black-clad sage appeared and told me that someone like you was coming and
I should ask for help with my needs.%% When the war was over I returned to find my farm
devastated by the filthy orcs! I hired mercenaries and managed to drive them off my land,
but their cursed stray war hounds remain and are rampaging and killing my cattle. Recently
they have even been threatening the farmers. %%If you are here to help, please kill the
*Turek war hounds*. Please kill at least 10 of them! Of
course they can be found near the *Orc Barracks*!
