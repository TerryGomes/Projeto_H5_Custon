!Katari:

At last! You have come for me! Oh, pardon me... I had a very vivid dream last night,
and I've been waiting for someone like you to come for me. Just in case you were the one in my dreams,
I wanted you to know. Well... then, I may as well ask you.%%
I and some religious ol mahums are being threatened by *scavenger wererats*.
They seem to be unaware of the teachings of the god of light. Everyone knows, even after a conversion,
ol mahums are not to be trifled with. The same can be said of the Dark Elves.
Our god of light is no coward, and I'm ready to teach them a thing or two.%%
Please, would you go kill these creatures? Bring back 10
*skulls of scavenger wererats*.
They can be found in the *Neutral Zone*.
Put a good scare into them, something to let them know they shouldn't pick on missionaries.
