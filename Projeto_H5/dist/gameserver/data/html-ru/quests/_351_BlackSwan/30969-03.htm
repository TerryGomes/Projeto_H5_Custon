!Iason Heine:

Oh yes, that is definetely the cargo that was stolen from our trade guild. But this is not all of it. There is still much to be recovered. Please continue to look for it.

Ah, the reward. I only have a small amount of cash on me. I'll tell you what, take this bill to *Head Blacsmith Roman* of Blacksmith guild. He will take care of you.
