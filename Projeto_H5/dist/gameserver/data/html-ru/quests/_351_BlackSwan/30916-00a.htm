!Captain Gosta:

Duke Iason Heine refused the Lord's offer, saying that it was a private matter and he would deal with it. This would be a good time to compliment the Duke on his concern for the public treasury, but, alas, I know him too well.

Anyway, I'm recruiting volunteers to drive away the Tasaba lizardmen for the Duke. He will personaly give out the rewards when we are successful. If you wish to volunteer, speak up now!
