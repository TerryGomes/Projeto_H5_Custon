!Rizraell:

All spirits in the ancient forest used to be friends to us Elves. But recently, some spirits have become violent. It's as if they were trying to get revenge on the Elves for the destruction of the forest.  I heard it was the angry wind spirit 'lirein' that recently caused the strong wind to destroy the roofs of the village buildings and break windows.

If the 'sylph' is the spirit of the cool breeze that blows between trees, then 'lirein' is a vengeful spirit of a wild storm. These spirits pluck trees from their roots and send animals flying high in the air. They are especially hostile to Elves. They come and go with severe winds, and we feel like they are trying to drive us from the forest.

 However, the 'wind shard,' a fragment of 'soul ore' that is within the body of a lirein, is a very precious resource. I use elemental stones to make various magic products, but among them, the wind shard is a material inevitably needed when making the 'scroll of wind'.

The scroll of wind is just as its name implies -- wind that is trapped in parchment. If you spread the scroll wide open, the strong wind sealed within will blow in the direction of your choice for a few seconds. This can be very useful for various tasks. It is used to change the direction of the wind east, to prevent the poisonous fumes coming from the Sea of Spores from entering the Elven forest. The scroll of wind is also bought by many Human and Dwarven sea navigators. I heard it is used when there is no wind on the ocean and the ship cannot move.

I am making several scrolls of wind due to the commission of Herbiel, but I am short of a few materials. Can you do me the favor of collecting wind shards?
