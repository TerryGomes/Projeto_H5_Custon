!Watcher of Valakas Klein:

I can see that you are determined despite my warnings. I will not try to stop you any further from your haste to find a quick death.

However, should you be one of the lucky few to actually survive the encounter with Valakas you will need proof that you have defeated the Fire Dragon.
