!Watcher of Valakas Klein:

What? You lost the necklace? How did you lose that necklace? That takes a special type of talent to lose something that cannot be lost.

Here... take this spare necklace I have. Do not "lose" this one. It is the only thing that can be used to prove that you have defeated Valakas.
