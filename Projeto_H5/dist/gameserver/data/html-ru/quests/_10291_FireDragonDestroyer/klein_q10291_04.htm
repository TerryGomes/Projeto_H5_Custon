!Watcher of Valakas Klein:

Take this Poor Necklace. By itself it is worthless. However, if combined with the blood of Valakas it will absorb some of his energy into the necklace. The reaction should be instant upon the defeat of Valakas.  The necklace will transform into a necklace of value. Bring me this as proof that Valakas has been defeated and you shall be rewarded.

You may wish to bring a small—er—very large army with you into Valakas Lair.
