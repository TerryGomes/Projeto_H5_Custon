!Watcher of Valakas Klein:

Impossible! I cannot believe it. No really, I cannot believe it. Usually I’m pretty good about sending adventurers to their death by facing Valakas, but you... just, wow. This is impressive. Soon all across the land will tell stories about the brave... what ever your name is, and how they defeated Valakas.

You should feel pretty good about yourself right about now. Too bad it won’t last more than 2 weeks. I don’t want to rain on your parade, but Valakas is Immortal. Sure you won’t see him around for a few days... but he’ll be back... mad as ever.

In any case, take this. A gift for the time you slew the dragon.
