!Watcher of Valakas Klein:

Ah… so determined I see. Are you sure you are ready to face Valakas? You may wish to reconsider.

A thought in my mind, years of being stopped by adventurers like you can do horrible things to a dragon’s spirit. Imagine all that pure rage combined with his newly found power... one could only hope that Valakas doesn’t like to play with his food.

You aren’t the first adventurer I’ve given this speech to. Last chance. Are you sure you are ready?
