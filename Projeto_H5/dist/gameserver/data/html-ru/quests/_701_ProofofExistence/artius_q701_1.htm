!War Mage Artius

I'm responsible for keeping the perimeter of the Alliance base safe, which I do by fire magic. Because of care about the great fire, I don't have the time to drive out the *Undead* that are recently haunting the area around the base.

You can help me out by destroying the Undead infesting the airspace *above the Seed of Infinity*. Moreover, I would very much appreciate it if you could kill *Banshee Queen Enira*, the leader of the Undead.

What you say, will you take my errand?
