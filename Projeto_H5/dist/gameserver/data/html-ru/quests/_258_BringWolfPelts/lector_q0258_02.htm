!Trader Lector:

I am a trader now, but I used to be a *leather craftsman*. In my youth, I served under Duke Van Daek. During the wars with Elmore, I made hundreds of suits of leather armor in just ten days for the duke's archers to wear. Even after retiring from the army, I buy materials from time to time and practice making leather armor so that my skills will not become rusty.

A few days ago Governor Windawood personally paid me a visit, saying that the newly formed militia needs armor, and placed an order for fifty suits of leather armor. It is no problem for me to make that amount of armor by myself, but I am worried because I am short on materials. I need quite a few *wolf pelts*. Can I ask you to get them for me?
