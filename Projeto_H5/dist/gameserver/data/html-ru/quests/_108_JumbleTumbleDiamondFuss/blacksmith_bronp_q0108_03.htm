!Blacksmith Brunon:

Have you recovered all my jewels? Not yet? Have you forgotten about our contract? I promised that if you restore all my jewels that the *goblin brigand subleaders* took from me, I would give you the diamond back that I won from your friend, Torocco. You have to find my *ten aquamarines* and *ten chrysoberyls*.
