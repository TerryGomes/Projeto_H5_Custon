!Blacksmith Brunon:

...This dice ...? Where did you get this? Thanks anyway. Is there anything else you want to tell me about?

Star diamond? Oh, you mean the fool's jewel that I won from gambling yesterday! I don't care about you people, but I won that jewel through a fair dice game. The jewel is mine now! No matter what you say, I will not give it back to him! You shouldn't ignore the sacred rules of gambling!

But, it seems like you are in some kind of trouble ... Then, how about this? If you do me a favor ... I will give you the jewel.
