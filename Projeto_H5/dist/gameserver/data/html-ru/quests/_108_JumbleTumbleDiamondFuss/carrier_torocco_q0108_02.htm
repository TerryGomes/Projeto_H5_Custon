!Carrier Torocco:

I received the star diamond at Giran ... .and drew a contract with Reep ... I told him that I would be responsible for delivery ... Everything was great when I was traveling ... And I got here, Kingdom of the Dwarves, last night ... I drank with my old friend, *Miner Maron* ... We have been friends ever since we were very young ... When we meet once in awhile, we have the bad habit of drinking until we pass out ...

... and we had quite a bit to drink last night ... But when I woke up in the morning, I found that my weapons, equipment, travel money, and the box where I put the star diamond were missing ...! I don't know what could have happened ... Agghhhhh ...! However ... Perhaps my friend Maron remembers something about last night ...

But he paid for the drinks last night, as well as for the tables and chairs I broke ... I'm too ashamed to meet him ... Why don't you go to the *strip mine* and ask him? Give this wine to Maron for me ... This is a rare wine I brought for him from Giran as a present ...
