You haven't found Kurupuru yet? I even gave you a drawing!!! He's a very cute *blade bat*! Kurupuru swallowed that star diamond or whatever it is you are looking for, and flew away ... He must be somewhere outside the village, all cold and dark ... trembling ... My poor Kurupuru ... You must find him!
