!Collector Gouph:

Good! Do you know *Trader Reep of the weapons shop*? He got the star diamond for me as my agent in Giran. That fellow is a master of bargaining, and so he got me a really nice price for the jewel. Go see him and ask him what's going on. If you show him this contract, that scoundrel can't play innocent!

And tell him this ... if that no-good crook is planning to cheat me, I will not let him get away with it!
