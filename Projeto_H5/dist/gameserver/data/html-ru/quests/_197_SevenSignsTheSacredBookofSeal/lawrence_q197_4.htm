!Great Teacher Lawrence:

Sigh... don't you see? "These are the records..." Now, where are records kept? The library! Start with the <font color="LEVEL">Library of Sages in Rune</font>--they have the oldest records collection in the kingdom.

I believe <font color="LEVEL">Sophia</font> is still the director there, and she has one of the most gifted minds in all of Aden.

Give her the number, and mention my name--I'm sure she'll give you all the help she can. But hurry... I fear the worst is yet to come.
