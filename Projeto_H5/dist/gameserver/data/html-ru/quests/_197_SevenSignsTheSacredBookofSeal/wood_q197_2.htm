!Priest Wood:

Oh, I know!

<font color="LEVEL">High Priest Orven</font> reads every scroll he can get his hands on. Perhaps he knows something about the Emperor's Key. He's at the <font color="LEVEL">Temple of Einhasad in the Town of Aden</font>. Tell him I sent you.

I'll send a messenger ahead of you. But hurry!
