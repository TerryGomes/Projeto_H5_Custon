!High Priest Orven:

His name is <font color="LEVEL">Leopard</font>, and he's a genius. I feel certain he'll be able to help you. You'll find him in the <font color="LEVEL">Town of Goddard</font>--you should arrange to travel there immediately.

I'll send my copy of the prayer to Leopard myself. Now hurry! I will pray to Einhasad for your success.
