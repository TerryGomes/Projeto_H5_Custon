!Priest Wood:

Oh my... I wonder if it was after you...or the sacred text?

Well, that settles it. Give me that manuscript and the object you found and I'll keep them safe. You must be exhausted! Rest for a while. When you've refreshed yourself, then come back and see me.

By then, perhaps Franz will be back as well.
