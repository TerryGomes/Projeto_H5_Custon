!Great Master Lawrence:

Let me read the prayer quietly..

<font color="LEVEL">The Emperor's Key!! Hmm... Back then the emperor of Elmore-Aden started the holy war. A winged messenger of Einhasad appeared, turning the tides of battle...</font>

<font color="LEVEL">The 6 catacombs became graves to followers of darkness.. The 7 Necropolis turned to battlefields for the army of death... This is how the divine Einhasad tells the tale.</font>

Hm..

Right... Now I've got it. It couldn't be simpler. Ha ha ha!
