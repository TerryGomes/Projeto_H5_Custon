!Atuba Chief Varkees:

What, you really didn't know about the Atuba tribe's totem? The heartless Atuba tribe's totem is the pointed fang! The ingredient to make this totem is the enemy Orc's fang!

Now you go to southern part of the land, kill the low level Orcs who lost their consciousness and dignity and get their fangs! We sent Seer Manakia to Giran Castle Town, go to him and show him this amulet. He will tell you in detail about the Orcs that you have to face!
