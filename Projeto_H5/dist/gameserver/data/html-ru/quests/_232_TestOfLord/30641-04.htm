!Duda-Mara Chief Takuna:

Tejakar Oroka! You've done a fine job! Spinning a web with intelligence, patience, and boldness reveals your warrior spirit of the spider!

I shall give you this 'crafted spider brooch' as a symbol of your intelligence, akin to the spider's. Take it to Paagrio Lord Kakai and you will be admitted!
