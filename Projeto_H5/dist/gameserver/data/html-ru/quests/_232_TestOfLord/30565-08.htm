!Paagrio Lord Kakai:

Good! Now listen to what I say! Do you remember the Cave of Trials, where you went to further your training as an apprentice? Ancestor Martankus lives in that cave. He is a great ancestral spirit that has been watching over our race for thousands of years.

I shall give you the bear fang necklace, the symbol of the Hestui tribe. Take this and go to the ancestral spirit! Pass the ultimate test that he gives you and receive acknowledgement as an Overlord! You shall learn the splendid history and honorable traditions of our Orc race. Hurry up and get to work!
