!Paagrio Lord Kakai:

I, Hestui tribe Chief Kakai, will oversee your trial. First, take this necklace! And now, with the exception of the Hestui tribe, go to the other five tribal chiefs and receive their acknowledgement that you are worthy of becoming a lord! As a mark of their acknowledgement, bring back the totems of each tribe!

Bring back the totems of all five tribes and I, Hestui tribal chief Kakai, will personally test you to see if you are worthy of becoming a lord! Tejakar Oroka!
