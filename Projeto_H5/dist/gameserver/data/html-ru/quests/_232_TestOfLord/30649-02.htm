!Ancestor Martankus:

I can tell by the grizzly tooth necklace that you wear that Kakai has sent you. 
So, you wish to take the Test of the Lord! You must learn of your ancestors' history 
first! Now, listen closely to what I say!

A long time ago, Paagrio the Lord of Flame created the First Orc. The First Orc was made of flame and hot lava, and came to this land to control the chaos. He came first to this place where you stand, known now as the Cave of Trials.
