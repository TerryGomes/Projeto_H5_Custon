!Neruga Chief Tantus:

Are you sure you know nothing about the Neruga tribe's totem? The totem of the undefeated Nerugas, the people who take pride in our long history, is the 'axe and arrow!' This symbol contains the spirit of the Nerugas who never back off, until we have defeated our enemy! 

The materials that are needed for making the totem are the Negura axe blade used in rituals, and one thousand bone arrows! Procure all of these and bring them to me! You can get the axe blade from Trader Jakal.
