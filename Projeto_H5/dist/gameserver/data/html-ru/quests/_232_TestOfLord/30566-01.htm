!Atuba Chief Varkees:

Dekara Lamchar Kakai! All praise the great Lord Kakai, Lord of the Flame of Paagrio! 
I see by the necklace you wear that you seek the Lord's judgment! Excellent! 

I, Varkees, chief of the Atubas, will share my knowledge with you. Tribes require symbols to rally around.  Each tribe has their own symbol known as a totem.  Once you understand the power that the totem gives to the Atuba fighters, your skills will identify you as their Lord.
