!Paagrio Lord Kakai:

Have you been around to visit the Orc chiefs of the six great tribes yet? Listen carefully!

The greatest of the tribes is Hestui, the tribe that I, Kakai, lead! You must seek out the chiefs of the Atuba, Neruga, Urutu, Duda-Mara, and Gandi tribes!

The chiefs of the Atuba, Neruga, and Urutu tribe currently reside here, in the Hall of the King!

Look for the Duda-Mara Chief in the town of Oren, and the Gandi Chief at Dion Castle Town!

The chiefs will test you to determine if you really are worthy of becoming a lord. Pass their test and receive the totem of their tribe as an acknowledgement of your skills!
