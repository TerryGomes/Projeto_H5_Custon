!First Orc:

I am the first and the last Orc, the sole receiver of Paagrio's energy, the patriarch of all Orcs! Though my physical form is gone and my soul hangs on by a thread, I linger to look after my proud Orc descendants!

In the beginning, Paagrio created me from the essence of fire. My body was forged in the eternal flame, and my power would destroy mountains!  My powers rivaled the gods'! When Paagrio ordered me to earth, I was set upon and killed by the jealous gods.
