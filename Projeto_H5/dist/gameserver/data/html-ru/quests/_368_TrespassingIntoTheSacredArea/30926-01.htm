!Priestess Restina:

Have you heard of the *Garden of Eva*? You may occasionally find goddess herself resting there.

She doens't like to be disturbed, so her garden is in the deepest part of sea, with entry gained only through an elaborate labyrinth.

Recently, *some who wish to harm her* have invaded her sanctuary. She's not there at the moment, and we, her priests and guards, are trying our best to drive out the invaders. However, this task is proving more than we can handle.

We're enlisting the help of outsiders to defeat them. Will you help us?
