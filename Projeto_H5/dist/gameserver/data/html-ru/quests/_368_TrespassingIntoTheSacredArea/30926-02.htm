Thank you. You should know that it is forbidden for outsiders to enter the Garden of Eva. We are breaking the rules, but these are desperate times.
Go to the *Garden of Eva* and slay the *blade stakato, the blade stakato worker, the blade stakato warrior, and the blade stakato drone*. As proof of your victory, bring back their *fangs*. You'll be rewarded for your efforts.
