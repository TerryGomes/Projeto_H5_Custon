!Arkenia:

The Dark Forest is peaceful and orderly, but Gludio is not like that. The wounds of war still run red in that place. A Sorcerer in the past went mad, and did things that should not have been done.

He made live Humans the subjects of his experiments. After the experiments, they were no longer Humans. The scientist turned them into skeletons, you see. *Kill the skeleton scouts in the Ruins of Agony in Gludio and find the Heart of Lunacy, left by that Sorcerer whose lunacy created the evil.*

Here is a perfume made from crushed herbs, it will defend your mind from the curse of that madness.
