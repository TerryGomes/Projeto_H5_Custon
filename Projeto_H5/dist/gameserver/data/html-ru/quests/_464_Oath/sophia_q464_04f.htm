This book hasn't aged a day... It was long ago and just after lunch. We were playing outside when <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias</font> who is now in Gludio Town used this book to squash a bee. We were both so terrified that the bee wasn't dead that we left it there. I meant to pick it up in a day or so, but somehow we both forgot. But now it is here, as if some cosmic fate is trying to tell us something. Listen..., hear that? I think it's saying 'hey, why not take me back to' <font color="LEVEL">Grand Master Tobias of Dark Elves Guild in Gludio Town</font>?
