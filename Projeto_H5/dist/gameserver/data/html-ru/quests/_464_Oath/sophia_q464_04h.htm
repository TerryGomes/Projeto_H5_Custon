!Library of Sages Director Sophia:

I never thought I'd see this book again. No seriously, a long time ago <font color="LEVEL">Agnes</font>, who is now called Saint of Light, and myself went camping. We realized we forgot the kindling needed to start the campfire, but she did have this book. Look, I'm a librarian, I can't really say what happened next... anyway... somehow it is back as if fate had its own plans for the book. 

...I think you should take it back to <font color="LEVEL">Agnes, Saint of Light in Goddard Town</font>.
