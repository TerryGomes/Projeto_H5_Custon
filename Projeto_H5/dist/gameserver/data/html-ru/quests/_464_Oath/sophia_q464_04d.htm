Ahh yes. I remember this book, <font color="LEVEL">Dominic</font> who is now a priest in Rune Town lost this book to me in a staring contest. But then I misplaced it and I haven't seen it since... 

...It sounds like coincidence, but it isn't. This book wants to go home. You found it, you should be the one to take it to <font color="LEVEL">Priest Dominic in Rune Town Temple</font> dont you think?
