!Library of Sages Director Sophia:

This book is actually quite familiar to me. Hmm... smell those pages! Decades ago I gave this book to <font color="LEVEL">Flauen</font> who is now the Gatekeeper in Heine. She and I were close friends growing up. But our paths separated and I've lost touch with her. I wonder what she's up to these days...? 

...Let me say this; I don't believe in coincidences. Perhaps you could do something for me... would you take this book to <font color="LEVEL">Flauen the Gatekeeper in Heine</font>? And tell my old friend that I said hello? If you do, I can take care of any late fees at the library for you...
