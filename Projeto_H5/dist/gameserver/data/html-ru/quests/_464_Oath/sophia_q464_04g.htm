This book is... hey I remember this book! You see, many winters ago <font color="LEVEL">Buryun</font> who is now a blacksmith in Schuttgart Town was using this book to sled down a snowy hill. I thought it looked fun and asked if I could try. I was going too fast though, and the book slipped out from under me as I went over a bank of snow. We never did find it..., 

...This is not just a coincidence. I think this book wants to return home, and I think because you found it that you should be the one to do it. Can you take it to the <font color="LEVEL">Blacksmith Buryun in Schuttgart Town</font>?
