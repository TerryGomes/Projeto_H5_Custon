I remember this book. The <font color="LEVEL">Priest of the Earth, Chichirin</font> who is now in Dwarven Village gave this book to me after putting gum in my hair. And though it is unlike me, I lost it and my hairbrush one sunny afternoon....

...Hey, do you believe in coincidence? Cause' I don't! I think you should return this book to <font color="LEVEL">Priest of the Earth, Chichirin in Dwarven Village</font> for me.
