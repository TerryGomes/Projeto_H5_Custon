Hey, I know this book...?! ...Where did you find this?? Incredible! Man... this thing brings back some memories eh? Well, like most things I guess you had to have been there. This was very nice of you. 

Dear Sophia... I wonder what she's up to anymore. Probably looks more like her mom now... Where does the time go?
