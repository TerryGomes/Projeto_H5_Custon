Let's see... There are so many of them...

Oh, I just remembered that you were a Dwarf! In that case, I would like you to go to your hometown and get rid of the animal slaughters there. How does that sound? That doesn't seem too hard for you, is it?

When you go to the Spine Mountains Mining Zone of your hometown, you'll find *the hunter tarantula, and plunder tarantula*. You can call them the most wicked animal slaughterers in the Spine Mining Zone. They say that they devour the animals every day. There are hardly any animals left near where they live.

Therefore you should go and get rid of them. By the way, when you return, you should bring some kind of proof that you killed the monsters. How could I possibly trust you if you come back with nothing to prove your victory? Now, if everything is clear, be off!
