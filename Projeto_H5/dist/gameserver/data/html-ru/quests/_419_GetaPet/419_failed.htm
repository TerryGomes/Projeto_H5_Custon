Wrong! You have failed the test. I am so sorry for you... You have tried so hard to make it up to here...

I shall give you one more chance to take the test again. Of course not just like this. *You'll have to meet the animal lovers association members once again and take some lessons from them*. Then, I shall give you another chance to take the test.
