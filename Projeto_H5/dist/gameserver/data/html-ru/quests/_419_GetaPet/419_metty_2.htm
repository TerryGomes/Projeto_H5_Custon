So, you want to learn about the pets? Good, I will teach you everything.

First of all, I'll tell you about the wolves, since it is the first pet that you will breed. A wolf, is an animal whose sense of smell can reach an object as far as *2.4 km* away. Also when they hunt, they have a habit of forming a pack of 7-14 with a *male* leader in front.

Concerning their appearance, a fully grown wolf won't necessarily be heavier than a grown-up man. The difference from a dog, which is a tamed animal, is that wolves always have their tail dangling down.
