!Pet Manager Martin:

Yeah. Very good! You have brought exactly 50 of them. Well done!

Hereby, I will give you a pet... is not what you are about to hear from me! Not yet, not too early. To be qualified for raising a pet is not so easy.

This is just the beginning. Now then, I shall give you some more tasks to see if you are qualified for raising a pet. Let's go on to the next level test, now!
