Chief Investigator Johnny:

Investigators *Sally* and *Laki* are supposed to have conducted the investigation and turned in their reports. I guess they haven't been delivered. I'll crack the whip on those two and make sure they get the results of the investigation back to Mouen. Anything you might be curious about the plains, just ask them. Personally, I don't go out there because the poison gets on my clothes, and these threads cost me a pretty penny. Clothes make the man, they say.
