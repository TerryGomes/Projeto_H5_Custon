!Grand Master Samael:

The* Archon of Halisha* has the next Stone of Commune.%%
You can find the Archon inside the Four Sepulchers in the Imperial Tomb. You mustn't enter that dreadful place alone!%%
If you're unable to form a party for some reason, massacre the Archon's minions in the Shrine of the Loyal. Kill enough of them, say around 700, and he will appear.%%
His minions are called Grave Scarabs, Scavenger Scarabs, Grave Ants, Scavenger Ants, Shrine Knights and Shrine Guards.%%
The Tablet of Vision that you seek can be found on the road to* Goddard from the Wall of Argos*.
