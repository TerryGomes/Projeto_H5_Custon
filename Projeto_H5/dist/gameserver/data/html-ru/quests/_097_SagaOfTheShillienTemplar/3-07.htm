! Grand Master Samael:

I need the* Divine Stone of Wisdom* that's held by Asefa, the highest-ranking shaman of the Ketra Orcs, or Soul Guide Udan Mardui, the highest-ranking shaman of the Varka Silenos. You must gain the trust of the highest-ranking shaman of either tribe in order to get the stone. Which tribe do you wish to approach?
