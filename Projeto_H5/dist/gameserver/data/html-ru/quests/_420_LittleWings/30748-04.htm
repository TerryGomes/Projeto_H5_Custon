!Drake Exarion:

You have found all my eggs! What a good job!

Yes, I remember the promise I made. In the name of Antharas I will give you one of my eggs. Take heed, once the egg is out of my protection, the baby inside will weaken and die if certain steps are not taken. You must take the egg to *Fairy Mymyu in Enchanted Valley*. Her magic will protect the baby inside the egg. I am very thankful for what you have done for me. Now you must hurry!
