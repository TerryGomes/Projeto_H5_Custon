!Maria:

Hmm...  A Deluxe Fairy Stone, eh?

It shouldn't be very difficult to make... Let's see what ingredients you have brought... Coal, Charcoal... gemstones... silver and Toad Lord Back Skins... It's all here! If you will wait a moment. I'll make it now.

Gemstone with base.. Polish with silver. Umm, from this angle it seems very similar to a Stone of Purity.

What is this, "Then reprocess with Stone of Purity again."? Hmm, is that really necessary? Anyway...
