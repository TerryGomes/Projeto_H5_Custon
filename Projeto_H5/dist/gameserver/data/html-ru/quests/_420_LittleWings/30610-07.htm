!Elder Cronos:

Why are you dawdling about? Don't you have your instructions? If you do not create the stone, I'll have nothing more to do with you! You must go see *Maria at Dion Castle Town*, she will tell you more. To find the *Toad Lord's Back Skin* you must go to the *Cruma Marshlands* yourself and capture a *Toad Lord*.
