!Fairy Mimyu:

Heh, heh... A Fairy Stone! It's a Fairy Stone... Ha, ha! Yeah, thank you, thank you. You're a really great person! Uh, huh... OK, I'm going to have to give you a gift of gratitude. If Mymyu gets a gift, she always gives a gift in return. What should I do for you? Huh? Huh? Well, ask me for anything later!
