!Fairy Mimyu:

Let's get started!

OK.... It's moving. You're doing a good job...

All right! There is the weak spot. Here you go... One, two, three..! Once more... One! Two! Three!

Ah ha!  A crack...

Alright, now come out under your own power! Here is your mother, little one... She will feed you and teach you many things!

OK, come on, let's go!  A little more!

OK... Good job...! Thank you!

OK... I'll take a look... Perhaps it's due to the fact that it wasn't nurtured by its mother, but this hatchling looks a bit scrawny.

Do you still have the Fairy Dust that I gave you? Could you give me some of that? I've got an idea...
