Shall we begin?

OK.... It's moving. Good job...

Alright! There's the weak spot. Together now... One, two, three..! Once more... One! Two! Three!

There's a crack... Alright, now come out under your own power! Here is your mother, little one... She who will feed you and teach you many things!

OK, now all the way out!

OK... Good job! Thank you!

Yes, the movement of the arms and legs seems normal... If it's well fed and cared for it should grow up normally. But the world is a very dangerous place, it can't be left unprotected.  <br>I shall hide the baby in the Elven world under my powers. Take this flute. You'll be able to summon the child at any time just by playing it.

Take heed...  If anything should happen to this baby I will cast my strongest curse upon you! Farewell!
