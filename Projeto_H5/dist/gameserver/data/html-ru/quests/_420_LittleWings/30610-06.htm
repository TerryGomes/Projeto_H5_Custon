!Elder Cronos:

Oh well, what do I have to lose? Here is the list of ingredients you will need in order to create a *Deluxe Fairy Stone*. Howover this cannot be accomplished easily, not even by a skilled Dwarven Artisan. I do know of a young lady named *Maria who lives in Dion Castle Town* who can make a Crystal of Purity. I think she may also be able to make a *Deluxe Fairy Stone*... If she can't help you I am afraid you may be out of luck. But you won't know until you ask, eh? By the way, among the ingredients, the *Toad Lord's Back Skin* cannot be purchased. You must go to the *Cruma Marshlands* yourself and kill a *Toad Lord* to collect it.
