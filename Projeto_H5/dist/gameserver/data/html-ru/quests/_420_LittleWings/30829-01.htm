!Pet Manager Cooper:

My, my! Hatchlings are very popular this season! I will tell you what I can about them. When they grow larger they are called striders and may be ridden. Later they mature into flying creatures called wyverns.

Take a look at this Katz. It's so cute and cuddly it's hard to imagine that they become such huge creatures! Ha Ha...

What is your interest in hatchlings? Would you like to raise one?
