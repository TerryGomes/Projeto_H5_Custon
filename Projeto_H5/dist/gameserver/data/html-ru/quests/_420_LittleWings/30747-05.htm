!Fairy Mimyu:

You haven't yet found the ones looking for their eggs?  Why not? Is it because the mountain was too high? Or perhaps, you forget the locations that I told you? OK, I'll tell you again.  Please remember it well!

The closest one to us... is *Drake Exarion, who lives at the top of the mountain to the west of Oren Castle*. It is a very difficult place for your tribe who cannot fly to reach.

*Drake Kalibran lives at the top of another mountain southwest of Oren Castle*. Two-legged races like yours typically have quite a bit of trouble climbing mountains, don't they?

*Wyvern Suzet is searching in the northwest side of Death Pass*, also quite a mountainous region...

And south from there... You will find *Wyvern Shamhai looking for her eggs in the low western mountains of Death Pass*.

And last, *Drake Zwov is in the reservoir of the west mountain ridge of Plains of the Lizardmen*. You shouldn't have any problem reaching her...
