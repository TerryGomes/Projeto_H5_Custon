!Guard Byron:

You wish to know how to meet a Fairy? Ha, ha... There is surely more than one way, my friend! If you find out one of them, let me know... 

The Fairies do not think like Humans do. One moment they seem terrified and the next they are open and friendly. But watch yourself, for just as quickly they can turn crueler than a demon... They will only show you what they want you to see.
