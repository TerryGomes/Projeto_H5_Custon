!Drake Kalibran:

... My eggs! They are all here! And still warm! How marvelous! Sob! Oooh.... Sniff...! Why are you staring? Do you take pleasure in seeing a drake cry?

Ah yes, the promise that I made to you. Oh my! How could you! No, no way...! Please, anything else! OK... Your kind loves money, don't you? I will do anything to give you as much as you want!  No?

How cruel you are! You must be aware that fairies cannot break a promise once made. Sob... I understand. A promise is a promise! You shall have one of my offspring. I beg you to raise my child into a great drake...

The eggs have been weakened by their ordeal and without nurturing the child will die. You must take this egg to *Fairy Mymyu*, she will know what to do. Please hurry!
