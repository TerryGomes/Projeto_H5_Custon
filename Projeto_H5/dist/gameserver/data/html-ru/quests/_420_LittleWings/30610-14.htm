!Elder Cronos:

Ah, another Fairy Stone! I had no idea you would actually make another one! May I examine it? It seems very similar to the last one. As I said before, you must go and see *Guard Byron*. He was born in this village and is the one to tell you what you should do next. Have you been to the deepest part of the Enchanted Valley as he suggested?
