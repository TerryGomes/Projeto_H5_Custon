!Wyvern Shamhai:

One of my eggs? I see... In other times, I would drag you into the sky and drop you to your death. But today I shall make an exception and listen to what you have to say...

All right. I accept your offer. However, this is on the condition that you will find and bring back all *20 of my eggs*. Understand? My eggs were stolen by the *dead seekers* who inhabit the place that Humans call the *Execution Ground*. Take one of my scales. Kill the dead seekers and find the 20 eggs that have the same pattern as my scales and bring them to me. When you complete this task you shall have one of my babies!
