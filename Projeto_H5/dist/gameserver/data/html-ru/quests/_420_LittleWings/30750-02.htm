Ah yes, you two-legged creatures must always receive payment for your efforts. I understand. My eggs were stolen by *road scavengers*. They attacked me and stole my eggs. I have no idea why they would do such a thing. They are camping *near the valley the Humans call the "Death Pass"*.

If you retrieve *all 20 eggs* of mine that were stolen, I will do anything within my power that you ask. Here is one of my scales. The pattern of my eggs will match its pattern.
