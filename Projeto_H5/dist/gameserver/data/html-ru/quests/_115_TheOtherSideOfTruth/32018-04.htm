Oh! You're going to work with us! Welcome aboard!

I'll tell you what I just found out. We lost touch with a large party of our Guild members who had been dispatched to investigate the recent activities of the Ice Queen.

We recently got lucky and found out where they might be...

It seems that the Ice Queen put a curse on them and turned them into ice sculptures! I think we should find out if there are any remnants of their investigation. The ice sculptures can be found on the *plains north of the entrance of the Ice Queen's castle*. Please, help us!
