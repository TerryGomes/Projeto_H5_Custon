A few days ago, while patrolling the *western parts of the School of Wizardry*, I encountered a werewolf *near a bridge*. I drew my bow and chased after him, but all of a sudden, his body started to waver, and he turned into a great toad! Do you think there are some werewolves that know how to perform strange magic?
