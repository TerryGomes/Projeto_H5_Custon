!Grand Sorcerer Gallint:

Young traveler of an alien race, how did you chance to journey to this remote island? I'm sure the Human world must seem fascinating to your eyes. I do wish I could speak with you longer, but unfortunately I have pressing matters to attend to, and cannot spend my time in idle conversation.

When we both have more time, won't you tell me about your homeland?
