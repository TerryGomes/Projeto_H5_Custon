!Grand Sorcerer Gallint:

I don't know why, but the magic defense field that I erected around the school of magic disappeared a few days ago. I have restored most of the shields, but I am worried that the spirits that were kept within the school for research have escaped to the outside.

If some spirits have escaped, I may have to ask you to go and capture them ...
