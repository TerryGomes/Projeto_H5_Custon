!High Priest Biotin:

Brave warrior, to seek out and eradicate the *seed of evil*, you must travel to the abandoned *Elven Ruins*. For directions to the abandoned Elven Ruins, ask Guard Kenyos who stands at the northern entrance of the village.

In my dreams the seed of evil that will lead a great evil into the world is lying dormant in the deepest depths of the cellars, gathering power. The seed of evil took the form of a *devil with large, grotesque red wings*, reminiscent of a bat. They came in a group, but one of them radiated an evil force greater than the rest. I am sure that he is the leader of this group.

I pray to Einhasad that our small power of good may be sufficient to defeat the darkness.
