!Warehouse Keeper Mia:

Our client wants us to find the secret contract between the Tasaba Lizardmen and Iason.
...
Listen carefully now...
Go to the *Field of Silence* and get rid of the *Tasaba Lizardmen and Tasaba Lizardman Shaman* there. Once you have done so, you will be able to obtain *both the pieces of the key to the Records Chest and the Records Chest itself*. I can make 1 key to the Records Chest if I have *10 pieces of the key*.
What we seek should be within the Records Chest itself.
Now go bring me the Records Chest and the pieces of the key we need to open it!
