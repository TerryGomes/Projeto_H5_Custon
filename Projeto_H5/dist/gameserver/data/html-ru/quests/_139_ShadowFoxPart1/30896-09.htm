!Warehouse Keeper Mia:

Do you know Iason Heine, the president of Heine Merchant Association?
He has been responsible for paying a large portion of the taxes owed to the lord, and for financially supporting the repair of Innadril Castle.
But some people say that he is simply waiting for an opportunity to seize greater power.
Our mission is to discover evidence that proves that Iason is in collusion with the Tasaba Lizardmen.
If this is true, it will seriously damage his career and reputation.
