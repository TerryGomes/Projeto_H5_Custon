!Warehouse Keeper Mia:

However, since you have been recommended by High Priest Sylvain...
You came to assist us in the search for the angel, eh?
To do so, you must join our organization as an agent. You must undertake the missions we assign you and serve our interests.
We are a neutral party in political, religious and cultural conflicts, entering into contracts with any and all sides if the price is right.
Agents and information dealers work independently on our clients' behalf and are sworn to secrecy.
