!Researcher Lorain:

Good to see you again. I've found out some interesting things about the type of metal used to construct this plate, but I haven't been able to determine what's inside. Apparently, we need to decode the password. As much as I hate to admit it, I think we need Nikola's help to solve this riddle. Would you go visit him for me?
