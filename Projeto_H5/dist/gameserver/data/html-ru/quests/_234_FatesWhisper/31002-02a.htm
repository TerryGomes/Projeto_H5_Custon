!Maestro Reorin:

I thought I had told you that already! I foolishly broke the guild's taboo and had dealings with a demon. My desire to create a masterpiece has been my ruin!

However, I cannot turn back the hands of time. My honor has been destroyed and all of my apprentices have abandoned me. My pride is long-gone. Now I am reduced to working for the favor of those filthy demons. I have earned my new nickname, "blacksmith of demons".

Now all I live for is the drink. Liquor is my only friend.
