!Maestro Reorin:

My rivals stole it from me when I was expelled from the guild! Instead of defending me, they helped themselves to my materials and tools! Thankfully, I was able to hide away my work journal.

I have heard that the *Head Blacksmith Ferris* in *Aden Castle Town* has my hammer. At one time he was one of my apprentices. When I had my problems with the guild, he turned on me like a bad dog. I cannot bear to see him. Please go and get my hammer from him.
