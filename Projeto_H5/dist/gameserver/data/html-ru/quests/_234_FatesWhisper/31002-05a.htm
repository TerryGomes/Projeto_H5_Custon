!Maestro Reorin:

Those wicked demons forced me to make an *infernium scepter*. Infernium is a very rare element, seldom seen since the time of the Titans. They told me that I should be honored to be working with such a precious material. I must admit that this thought appealed to me, and I quickly set about creating the scepters for them.

Now it is clear what I must do. I must recover the three scepters and melt them away so that they cannot be used by the demons. This will restore my honor! To do this, I will have to confront *Death Lord Hallate and his minions*! I will not be successful without your help. Please, help me do this!
