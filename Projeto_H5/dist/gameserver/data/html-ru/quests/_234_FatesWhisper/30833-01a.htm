!Magister Kaspar:

Oh! You're the one who explored the Tower of Insolence on behalf of Reorin!
 Hardin's Academy is not your ordinary place of learning. It constantly monitors world affairs.

Recently there have been interesting developments around the Tower of Insolence.
 Even now, forces are gathering to fight over ancient relics that are supposedly hidden in the tower.
 Of course, our interests are different from theirs...

We hope to collect *Baium's blood* from the Tower of Insolence.
 Surely you have heard of how Baium was descended from King Shunaiman, who received the blessing of Einhasad in person!
 We must obtain the accursed royal blood from his veins.

But... No. This is extremely hard. You are too weak to do this. Just bring us 30 Fabric, blooded in the Baium's guardians blood.
 They will be passes to the Baium. Meet Hanellin in the Aden Town to obtain more information.
