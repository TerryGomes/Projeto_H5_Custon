!Maestro Reorin:

Have you brought 984 B grade crystals? What wonderful timing! The temperature of the metal is just about right...

Hmm, we're going to need another ingredient! The pure infernium is too soft... It must be combined with very pure mithril to make an alloy.

High quality Mithril Ore is quite rare these days. It would be much easier to just melt a B grade item.

*You must tell me now what kind of B grade weapon you will bring back! I'll prepare the melted infernium and set the ratio accordingly. Choose carefully!

Also, if you throw a weapon into a furnace, its enchantment and special capabilities will disappear. Please bear this in mind!*
