!Maestro Reorin:

Don't bother! The only way I could possibly have my honor restored would be to stop my dealings with demons. However I... I... cannot refuse their requests.

They have the soul of my wife, and are holding her hostage! If I don't do exactly as they say, they will throw her soul into eternal torment! I cannot let this happen to my dear Reiria, my honor is sacrificed for her!
