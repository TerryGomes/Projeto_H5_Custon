Trader Zenkin:

Sorry, my friend, I've already sold it! Just think about it! It was used by one of the top 10 artisans in the kingdom. Who wouldn't want to own it?

Let me check my book. Please give me a minute. Ah, here it is. *Magister Kaspar* bought the mold a few months ago. He lives at *Hardin's Academy*. Anything else I can help you with?
