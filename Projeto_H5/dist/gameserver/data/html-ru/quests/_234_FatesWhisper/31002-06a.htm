!Maestro Reorin:

My former apprentice *Cliff* should have some. I must admit, I cannot bear to look him in the face. Through my darkest days, Cliff stuck by me. He only left after I became drunk and physically threw him out...

Please go see Cliff and obtain the Infernium Varnish. He is now a *warehouse keeper* in *Oren Castle Town*. I am counting on you, my friend!
