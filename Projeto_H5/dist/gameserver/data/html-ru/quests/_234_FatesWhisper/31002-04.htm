!Maestro Reorin:

That is all very hazy to me. I was sitting on my front porch, drunk as usual, and she appeared. She was accompanied by a black knight. Although I shall never forget that day, I cannot tell you much about their appearance. Now it seems like it was a dream... I do remember that she had an other-wordly beauty, with blonde hair and blue eyes. The knight was quite old, with gray hair and a dark countenance. Other than that... I cannot say...
