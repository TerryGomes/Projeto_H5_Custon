!Head Blacksmith Ferris:

Do you know Reorin? Then I suppose you've heard the news of his pardon! He's been reinstated as a regular guildsman! In the nick of time if you ask me. The guild could not afford to lose a maestro such as him.

What's that? You are here for the *Hammer of Maestro Reorin*? Yes! It was seized when the maestro was expelled from the guild. Now take it back to him. Please congratulate him for me and tell him that I am looking forward to seeing the results of his new project.
