!Maestro Reorin:

Well, you see, I was out of money and I really needed a drink, and well, you know...I sold it to *Trader Zenkin* of *Oren Castle Town*...

Could I ask you but one more favor? Will you please go and see Trader Zenkin and buy the mold back for me? Oh, thank you! You are such a helpful person!
