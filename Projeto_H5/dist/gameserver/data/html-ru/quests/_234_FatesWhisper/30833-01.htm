!Magister Kaspar:

Ah, you must have come for Maestro's Reorin's Mold. How is Reorin?

I should check you out. Uh oh, did I say that out loud? Sorry... I was just talking to myself

If you knew what I went through to get this mold, you would understand why I can't just give it to you for nothing... If you ask me to set a price on it, I will set it so high that you could not possibly afford it. But there is another way you can get it. Perhaps you could do a favor for me...
