!Maestro Reorin:

Be patient my young friend! I shall create a marvelous weapon for you, one that will make the earth tremble!

Clang! Clang! Behold the power of the hammer of Maphr! Clang! Clang!

Boom! Boom! Forged in the flames of Paagrio! Clang! Clang!

Bang bang! Immersed in the water of Eva! Clang! Clang! Splash!

Bang! Bang! Cooled with the wind of Sayha! I hear her laughing in my ear! Bang! Bang!

Clang! Clang! The flames of passion heat the metal to the core! Such is the love in my heart! Clang! Clang!

...Voila! It is finished! Not to toot my own horn, but I'm one of only a handful of Dwarves capable of creating A grade weapons on this continent! I, Maestro Reorin, present you with this weapon! Also, take this mark engraved with the Phoenix of Revolution or the Messenger of Dawn. The mysterious woman who foretold your coming asked me to give it to you...

I suppose our time together is over. Thank you for your help. If you see that mysterious woman again, give her my regards!
