!Elder Arin:

Have you ever traveled by *airship*? It is the ultimate transportation, and we of the Black Anvil Guild created it with our combined technology. The sight of the airships flying high in the sky makes people sigh with admiration.

But they say that the flying mechanisms of the giants of ere were greater in size than those of today, faster than the wyverns, and could even fly higher than the clouds. My dream is to restore the forgotten flying technology of the giants. I wonder what our land looks like from the sky, through the clouds ... Doesn't imagining that just make you happy?

I am very busy with my guild business, but I try to study the *floating stones*, the basic element of flight, whenever I get the chance. Floating stones are a peculiar metal that have the characteristic of hovering in the air, and I believe that the key to unlocking the secret of the giants of ere lies in finding a method to control the floating stone's powers. But I always run short of study materials, so I often ask apprentices like you to collect floating stones.
