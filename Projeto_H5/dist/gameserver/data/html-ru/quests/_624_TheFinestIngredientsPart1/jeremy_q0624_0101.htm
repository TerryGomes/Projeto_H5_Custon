!Chef Jeremy:

This is terrible. Terrible!

That promising young chef Donath will be in the cooking competition, and unless I make something truly special I fear he will walk away with the top honors. But what to make, what to make?

There IS one dish, but the ingredients are so difficult to get that I doubt I could acquire them in time. Unless...

Hey, you there! Yes, you! Interested in a job? I need a brave and resourceful adventurer for a specific task.

How would you like to assist me -- Chef Jeremy, the greatest chef of this region -- in making a fantastic dish?

If all goes well, *you may receive an Ice Crystal* in return for your assistance.
