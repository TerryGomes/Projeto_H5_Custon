!Elder Casian:

Did you also feel the wave of magic emanate from Hellbound a few days ago?
Hmm, given your power level, it-s odd that you didn't feel it...
I have conducting my own investigation recently. I discovered the path to Hellbound has been opened. Fortunately it is not due to Beleth awakening.
I believe it is rather the strength of the Witch that has broken the barrier. If you wish to go to Hellbound, I think you should go find the Witch.
