!Elder Casian:

A *Blue Crystal...*
You ask for the gift i received from the Water Dragon itself when i was young. It is very precious to me.
Tell me, did you think I would simply hand it over to you?
Hmmph!
But since *Galate* asked you to retrieve this not simply to test you, but because she actually needs it... Very well, take this to her.
I hope this is the last time our paths cross...
