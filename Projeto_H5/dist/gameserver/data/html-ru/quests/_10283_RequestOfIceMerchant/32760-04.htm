Jinia:

Ah, well, why didn't you say so to begin with? That information is known only to a select few amongst my Guild. I apologize for threatening you earlier, I have a lot on my mind just now.

I will tell you though, you search Kier in vain. The Divine Sword is not here. You should go back to Rafforty and we can catch up there.
