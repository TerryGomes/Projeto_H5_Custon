!Bloody Pixy:

I know what you want! You have come for the bloody fairy dust!  Do you think I would just give it to you for free?

If you do me a favor, I will give you what you seek. So listen closely!

Our queen is a collector of bones. She seems most happy when she is arranging the skulls of strange animals. I admit, she is a little eccentric, but she is my queen!

I will give you the red fairy dust if you bring *10 skulls* each, from the *Grandis, Karull bugbear, Breka Orc Overlord, and the Leto Lizardman Overlord*! I swear on this jewel!
