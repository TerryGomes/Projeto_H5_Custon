!Magister Kaira:

At last, there is some report on *'Kaisha's Revelation'*which was thought to be lost. Although the religious reformation by Humans distorted many facts about Goddess Shilen, this revelation contains the truth about Goddess Shilen written in the Giant ages. If only we could find the revelation, we would be able to have a better understanding of the Goddess and the power of death from which it generates. 

Doubtless, the original scroll of the revelation has been destroyed. But the copy of the revelation is being handed down until this day. Do you know about Hornius the Human Scholar from the imperial era? It is said that he was killed by the believers of Einhasad during his research on Kaisha's Revelation. But they say that one of the pupils had made a copy of the revelation.

The name of the pupil is Alder. He used to be a brother belonging to the shrine. At the Inquisition, he saved himself from being burned at the stake by swearing that he would convert to Einhasad. But according to the recently found reminiscences of Alder, he believed that Kaisha's Revelation was an important source of historical research and, therefore, secretly made a copy and hid it somewhere. We must find that.
