That is what I heard from my grandmother when I was young... She told me to remember it until my dying day, and be sure to pass  it on to my children. I couldn't understand the meaning exactly, but I could feel that it was talking about something very important. She said that if someone comes to me and says those words, I must give this thing to that person. I am not sure, but I think it is some kind of *slip*. If you look up here, it says *'Gludin warehouse'*. Take it . See what it is all about.
