!Magister Kaira:

It is said that the Remains of Alder are placed here in Einhasad's shrine of this village. If only we could acquire the remains, we would be able to summon the spirit of Alder from hell through an exorcism ritual.  Then we could ask him where he had hidden the copy of the revelation.

Recently , brother Metheus contacted us . He told us that he can hand over the Remains of Alder which are placed in the shrine. First go and meet *Brother Metheus*. He is in *Einhasad's shrine* of this village.
