!Brother Metheus:

Thank you so much. At last my sister can have a decent burial...

If you could please help me with one more thing, I need you to bring me some *'Belladonna'*. I have read that this poison can kill a bull with just one droplet!  I intend to kill the Priest Criton who executed my sister with this same poison.

Isn't it true that your race has some familiarity with poisons? 

Please fetch the belladonna as soon as possible and I will give you the skull of Brother Alders.
