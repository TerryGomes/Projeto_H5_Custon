!Alder's Spirit:

This is a copy of Kaisha's Revelation, ancient religious scriptures that I transcribed at great risk to my life. I will safeguard it for future generations. Although it is dark elves who now seek its secrets, I find it rewarding that such an old truth is again known to the world. 

You may obtain a written copy of the revelation from Gludin's warehouse. First you must obtain a bill from my daughter '*Roa*' who lives in this village. Go to her and say '*The moon emits light though you hide it with your hand*.' She will then give you the bill.
