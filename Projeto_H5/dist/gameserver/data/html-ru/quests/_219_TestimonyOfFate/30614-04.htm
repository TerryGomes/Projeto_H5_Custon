!Brother Metheus:

Please bring me the  *'Belladonna'*. I intend to use it to avenge the death of my sister. I know that your race has some familiarity with poisons.  From what I hear, there is a Dark Elf called 'Ixia' who is a real poison expert!

If you will bring me belladonna, you will receive the skull of Brother Alders you want so badly.
