!Warehouse Keeper Norman:

I remember... I've read it in an old account book. We Dwarves are very strict on keeping the account book. It is recorded that when my predecessor first came here to the town's warehouse, a pale looking man with a priest gown left a scroll with him.

It is the Steel Gate Guild's principle to protect all deposited things thoroughly, so we have kept the scroll in the locker for the last 200 years. Although your chit that you brought is also very old, there is no doubt that it is issued by our warehouse. Wait a moment. I shall bring the deposited goods.

Here! Take it. I am telling you, some pages in this book are torn ... But that was how it looked like from the beginning!
