!Magister Kaira:

Finally,*the complete copy of the revelation*which was thought to be lost 200 years ago is in our hands, at last. Good job, brother of darkness. Thanks to your efforts our tribe will have an even better understanding of the power of darkness. In appreciation of your endeavors, I will give you the opportunity to promote to a higher rank. I bet that is want you want, as well.
