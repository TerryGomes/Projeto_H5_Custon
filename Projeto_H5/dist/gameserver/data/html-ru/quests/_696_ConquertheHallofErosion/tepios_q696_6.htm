!Officer Tepios:

To enter this area, you must show <font color="LEVEL">Keucereus' Proof - 1st Phase</font> as evidence that you have completed the attack mission for the Hall of Suffering. How can I trust you unless you have already demonstrated your worth? Ability is the only thing that concerns me. If you think you have the ability, prove it.
