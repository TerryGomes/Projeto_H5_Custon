!Officer Tepios:

Well done! This was not an easy mission. Thanks to you, I think we will be able to reduce Ekimus' influence in this area.

Here is <font color="LEVEL">Keucereus' Proof - 2nd phase</font>. You will need it to enter the other area. Of course, I cannot order you to go there.

But you are brave enough that I know you will do the right thing. If we are to ever regain our land, it will thanks to the efforts of courageous adventurers like you. Many thanks!
