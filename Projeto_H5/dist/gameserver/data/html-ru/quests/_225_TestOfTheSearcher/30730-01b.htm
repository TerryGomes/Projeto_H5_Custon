!Bodyguard Jax:

I buried the gold in the Dion's southern forest. We made a map to the place, divided into 4 pieces and gave took 1 piece each. We could never find it again with just 1 piece... 

I knew that the gold was cursed after I heard about the unfortunate deaths of my 3 comrades.  So I decided to forget it all and live quietly here.
