!The drunken fool Boris:

Ahh...  This is it!  Outstanding! My tongue is loosed by the fragrant nectar... 

Obviously the Lord's gold was being transported from Gludin to Dion. The 4 royal Guards carrying the gold schemed to hide it away...  The Lord unsuccessfully pursued them. Somehow people got the idea that they perished in an accident..

Actually, one of them, named Rovelt, is still alive.  Now he goes by *Guard Jacks* and guards the Dwarf traders. He is probably somewhere in *the southern part of the Wastelands* now. He will tell you everything if show him this. Take it and go, my young friend.
