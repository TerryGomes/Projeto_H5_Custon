!Alex:

I believe this map will lead us to the prince's gold! I wonder how that delu lizardman 
got this? 

If we can get to the gold before our opponents we will be able to hire soldiers and buy weapons with which to defend the village.

Think of this as your last test.  You must find the other parts of this map and *get the prince's lost gold bar*. 

Whether you are successful or not, I will write you the letter of recommendation you need.
