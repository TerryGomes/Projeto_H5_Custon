!Trader Tyra:

Did you forget our contract? Shall we take a look at the papers? *'A bottle of Malrukian Wine shall be traded with 10 pouches of the Red Spore Dust'*. You can see our signatures, both mine and yours, down here. You'll be able to get the Red Spore Dust by killing the *giant fungus* of the *Sea of Spores*. I hope you fulfill the contract soon.
