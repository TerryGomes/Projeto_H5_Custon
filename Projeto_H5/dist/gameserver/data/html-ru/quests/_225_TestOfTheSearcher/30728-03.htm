Thank you. Thanks to your help, we now can pause for breath a while... One more thing. According to the latest news it seems that their real purpose is not the invasion of Floran Village... They seem to be looking for something in this area. What kind of precious thing could it be that the whole tribe is looking for it... Perhaps *Delu Chief Kalkis* knows something about it. Will you be able to go and investigate and kill him afterwards?
