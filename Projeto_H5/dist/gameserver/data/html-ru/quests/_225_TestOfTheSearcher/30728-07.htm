!Militiaman Leirynn:

I heard that you got special missions from*Alex*. I am so grateful that a stranger like you who doesn't even belong to this village is working so hard for us. I don't know exactly, but I heard that the militia is no longer starving thanks to you...

When the time comes, will you let me invite you to dinner?
