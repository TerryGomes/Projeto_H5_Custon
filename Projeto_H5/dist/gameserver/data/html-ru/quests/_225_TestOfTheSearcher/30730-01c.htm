!Bodyguard Jax:

Solt and I were very close... He died on his way home to Elmoreden. Murdered by thieves called *Road Scavengers*...

Makell was the idealist, he joined the rebel army... In the end, he was caught and executed. His body was hung from a tree as a reminder to others... This tree grew animated, and is now known as the *Hanged Man Ripper*.

Rambert was very much like me, working as a high trader's Guard. He lost his life in battle with a delu lizardman. 

And now you hold the map!
