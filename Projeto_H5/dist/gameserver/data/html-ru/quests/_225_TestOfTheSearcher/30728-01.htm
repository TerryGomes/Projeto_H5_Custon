!Militiaman Leirynn:

Welcome. Recently a lot of delu lizardmen are gathering together. I guess that they are watching for a town with a weak defense. The villagers are relying heavily on us, it makes me anxious that we don't know a way to escape it either... We are relatively weak compared to them so our only choice is the guerilla tactic...

I know it must be too sudden for you, but please find the *delu lizardmen's shaman* and get rid of them. They say that there are *10* of them all together.
