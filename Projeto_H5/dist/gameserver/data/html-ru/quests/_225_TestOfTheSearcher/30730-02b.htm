!Bodyguard Jax:

Makell was incensed by Prince Ashton's tyranny and joined a rebel army of farmers. Eventually he was caught and executed. He was hanged with other rebels.

Prince Ashton decreed that his body be hung from a tree as a lesson to others...but the tree itself became animated and is now called *Hanged Man Ripper*, and roams about the *scaffold*.
