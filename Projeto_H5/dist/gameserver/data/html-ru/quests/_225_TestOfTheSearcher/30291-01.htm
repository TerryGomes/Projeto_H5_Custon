!Alex:

Welcome, my friend.  If Master Luther sent you here you must be ready to get to work.  

Floran Village needs more good workers like you. We don't have a guard or even a single skilled person!

I have been waiting for you since I received the warrant of appointment.  Take this and give it to my adjutant *Militia Leirynn*... 

She is a modest lady. I am afraid that work here may not be as easy as you think... I thank you in advance.
