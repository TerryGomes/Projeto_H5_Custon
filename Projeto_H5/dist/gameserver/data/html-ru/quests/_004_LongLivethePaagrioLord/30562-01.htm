!Warehouse Keeper Grookin:

I, Grookin represent the Neruga and offer this precious gift to the Paagrio Lord! My tribe offers him the *bloody axe*. This ax is stained with the blood of many animals and encases their spirits, pulsating with strong spirits of life! It is said that merely possessing this on the body can defeat illness!
