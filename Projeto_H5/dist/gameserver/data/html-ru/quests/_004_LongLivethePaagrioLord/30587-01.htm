!Gantaki Zu Urutu:

We Urutus have decided to offer the lord a rare *deep sea orb*, a jewel that has been hard to find on the Immortal Plateau until now.

This orb, brought out from the depths of the black seas of the west, is an object called a "pearl" by Humans! Those that carry this orb on their person gain the ability to see into the future. There is no better gift than this for the Paagrio Lord, leader of the Orcs!
