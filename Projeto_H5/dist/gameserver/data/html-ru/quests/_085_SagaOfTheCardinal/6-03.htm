!Tablet of Vision:

Countless thoughts beyond comprehension sear painfully into your brain. Images twist inside my mind until they finally slow down and I begin to see something familiar...%%
The pain lessens and I am able to make out the location of the Tablet. I see the next Tablet to find The background of the Tablet resembles* the North of Border Outpost*. The Stone of Commune cannot be far though I cannot discern its exact location... It looks like Haures whom I recognize from a picture is a book. I peer at it closer, but the visions fade. Everything returns to normal. I will go to* the North of Border Outpost* where the Stone of Commune is.
