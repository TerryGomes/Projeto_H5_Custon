!Saint of Light Agnes:

I'll fill the granary with this generous gift. Thanks to your help, these people can walk the path of light once more.%%
Now I can help you! A man named* Franz* told me of how one can step beyond his own limitations. You remind me quite a bit of him.%%
Take this Stone of Commune to the Tablet of Vision* south of the Tower of Insolence*. It will give you new knowledge.
