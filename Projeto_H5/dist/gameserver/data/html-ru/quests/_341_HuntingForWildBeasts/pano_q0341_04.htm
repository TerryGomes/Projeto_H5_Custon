!Grocer Pano:

Excellent! I bet you'll give those filthy bears what they have coming. Kill *the Dion grizzly*! Most of the bears by the river have already been killed, so you'll need to search nearby... Try the Dion Hills...

In Gludio you will also find *red bears, grizzly bears and brown bears*. I hate those filthy beasts! If I could I would obliterate every single stinking bear on earth!

Bring me at least *20 bear pelts*. You'll be well-rewarded.
