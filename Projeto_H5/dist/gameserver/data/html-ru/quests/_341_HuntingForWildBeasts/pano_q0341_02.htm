!Grocer Pano:

I am beside myself!

Would you mind if I tell you my problem? Recently the salmon population in *river to the west* of this village has exploded. This is not even the spawning season and yet all the fish are returning at once. I feared that this may be an omen of bad things to come, but the businessman in me saw a great opportunity. In spite of my reservations I started selling fishing gear and opened a resort.

Sounds great, right? Well, the problem is...

You know, I don't really feel comfortable talking about my problems with you. Why don't you come back when you've had more experience. I will have something to ask of you then.
