On this Primeval Isle you'll find primitive creatures called dinosaurs -- you'll never see anything like them in Aden, believe me! According to wise wizads, even the gods and Giants were afraid of the dinosaurs. They cannot be found in Aden -- thankfully -- but are still plentiful on that strange island.

Around the wharf, you'll find only relatively weak ones, but they are still a challenge for even the hardiest adventurer.

The wizard Karakawei has been pestering me to acquire some of those creatures' bone for study. If you defeat them and bring back their bones, I will purchase them from you on his behalf. What do you say?
