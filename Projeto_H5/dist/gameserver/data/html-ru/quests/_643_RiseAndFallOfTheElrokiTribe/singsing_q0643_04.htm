Ah, an adventurer! Are you looking for a job? Since the discovery of this Primeval Isle, Aden port has added a wharf for those interested in seeing the strange new island for themselves.

In fact, we're getting flooded with adventurers and wizards eager to uncover the island's mysteries or test their mettle against the terrible creatures there.

We handle tickets here for the ship bound for the island as well as offering accommodations for those who wish to trade with the natives.

Now we have expanded our service to connect adventurers with those in need of their services.

I have just one request, but hmmm...

I don't think that you're suited for this particular task.
