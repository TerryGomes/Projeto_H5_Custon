!Shaman Karakawei:

To undertake the necessary ritual, I need *300 bones of dinosaurs from the plains*. Unless I do this, the curse cannot be lifted; Shilen's grace will be forever denied to us, I fear.

Please make haste and hunt *Pachycephalosaurus and wild striders* and bring back *300 bones of dinosaurs from the plains*.
