!Vice Hierarch Perwan:

I knew I could entrust you with this mission! Now listen carefully. Kill the Crimson Spiders, no matter how many you find. Collect *Crimson Spider Claws* as proof. The *Crimson Spiders* have been seen recently in Mimir's Forest, but they also live in other habitats.%%
Good luck!
