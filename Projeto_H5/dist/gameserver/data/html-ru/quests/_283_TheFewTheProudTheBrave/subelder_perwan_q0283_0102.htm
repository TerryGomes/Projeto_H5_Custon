!Vice Hierarch Perwan:

I will pose you this question: Suppose you find yourself in a precarious sitution; what is your most effective weapon? Power? Experience? Skill? Very important, all of them.

But think of something even more essential for victory. Courage! That is the mark of the true Warrior. As it happens, I have a mission that will require someone with exceptional courage.

Hmm... I do not think you are yet ready. Perhaps with more training... Why don't you come back and see me then?

(Only characters level 15 and above are permitted to embark on this quest.)
