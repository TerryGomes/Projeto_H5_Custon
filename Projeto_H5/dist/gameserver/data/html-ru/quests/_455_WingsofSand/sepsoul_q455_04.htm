!Separated Soul:

He has his loyal subordinates, their group is called *Wings of Sand*.

They are preparing the attack simultaneously so it'll be hard to defeat them.

But there's a way. Use Dragon Vortex to summon any of the seben of them: *Emerald Horn, Dust Rider, Bleeding Fly, Black Dagger Wing, Shadow Summoner, Spike Slasher, Muscle Bomber*.

Once you can separate each of them it'll give you a chance.

I need you to kill as more as you can, but I can reward you for *one* of *two* monsters slayed.
