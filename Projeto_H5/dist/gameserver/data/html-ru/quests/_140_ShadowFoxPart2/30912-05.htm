!Magister Xenovia:

I will give you the encoded document if you make the 3 Dark Oxides with materials you find on your own using my equipment.
It is very difficult to produce the Dark Oxides successfully because the process is very complicated.
And if you fail, you will be responsible for the cost of the materials...
