!Magister Xenovia:

I will prepare 3 solutions if you bring me the Dark Crystal.
One of the 3 solutions will be able to produce the Dark Oxide.
Unfortunately, I cannot yet produce perfect solutions every time.
What you will need to do is choose one of these 3 solutions and then place 5 Dark Crystals in it.
