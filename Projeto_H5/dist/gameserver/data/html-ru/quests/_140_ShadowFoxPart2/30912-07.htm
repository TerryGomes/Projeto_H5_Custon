!Magister Xenovia:

Go to the *Field of Whispers* and hunt *Crokians, Dailaons, Crokian Warriors, and Parhit* in order to collect the *Dark Crystals*.
You will need at least 5 of them for each experiment.
If you successfully carry out the experiment using the *Dark Crystals*, you will be able to produce Dark Oxide. I will give you the Cryptogram of the *Goddess Sword* in exchange for *3* Dark Oxides.
