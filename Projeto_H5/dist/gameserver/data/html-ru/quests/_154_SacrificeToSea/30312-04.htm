!Lighthouse Keeper Rockswell:

Long ago, they say they sacrificed virgins to the sea, but times have changed and there is no sailor who keeps this tradition. Instead, we set afloat a boat that contains a doll in the shape of a Human maiden. Now we have to make that doll.

I've asked *Warehouse Keeper Rolfe*, who is handy with his hands, to make the doll, but we still have to make the doll's long hair. For that, I need high quality *fur yarn*.

Hunt the *keltirs* on the island and gather about ten bundles of fur, then take them to *Cristel* in the next village. You can find her at the well in *front of the village warehouse*. Give the fur to *Cristel*, and she will spin it into yarn. Take the yarn and give it to *Warehouse Keeper Rolfe*. He will probably finish the doll on the spot. As soon as the *doll* is finished, bring it back to me. I will give you generous reward for your labor.
