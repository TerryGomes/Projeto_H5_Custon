!Lighthouse Keeper Rockswell:

I see you haven't gathered enough *keltir* furs yet. Gather *ten keltir furs* and take them to *Cristel*, who will spin them into yarn. You can find her at the well in *front of the village warehouse*. Take the *keltir fur yarn* to *Rolfe*. You can find *Rolfe* at the *warehouse*.
