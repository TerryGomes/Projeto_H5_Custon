!Blacksmith Wilbert:

All right! If that's what you want, I'll let you join in.

You can't be ready for the game already, can you? You're not thinking of joining in without bringing anything to the table, are you? You have to go get one item if you want to enjoy a game with us. It's not so hard to find, but we need to have *Spirit Beads* to make weapons. I'll give you the details another time, but for now, go to *Aden Cemetery, the Ancient Battleground* and the *Fields of Massacre* and get some <*Spirit Beads* from the undead and the demons.

Did I explain enough?
