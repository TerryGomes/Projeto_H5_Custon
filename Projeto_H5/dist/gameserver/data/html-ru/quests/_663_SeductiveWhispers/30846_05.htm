!Blacksmith Wilbert:

When a being's thought or spirit energy comes together into the shape of a bead, we call that a Spirit Bead. Artisans like me need them to make good weapons. That's why we gamble with them -- as they're worth a lot to us. In this area, the say that you can easily get Spirit Beads if you go to *Aden Cemetery, The Ancient Battlegrounds* and *the Fields of Massacre*.

First, at *The Cemetery*, you can obtain *Spirit Beads* from undead creatures known as the *Spiteful Ghost of Ruins, Soldier of Grief, Cruel Punisher, Roving Soul, Tortured Undead* and *Wasted Soul*.

Second, at *the Ancient Battlegrounds*, you can obtain *Spirit Beads* from undead creatures known as *Past Knight,Ghostly Warrior, Hungered Corpse, the Dark Guard, Death Agent* and *Nihil Invader* and form the demons known as *Bloody Lord, Bloody Priest, Bloody Knight* and *Bloody Ghost*.

Lastly, at the *Fileds of Massacre*, you can obtain *Spirit Beads* from undead creatures known as *Doom Scout, Doom Servant, Doom Guard, Doom Archer, Doom Trooper, Doom Warrior, Doom Knight, Wretched Archer, Spiteful Soul Leader, Spiteful Soul Wizard* and *Spiteful Soul Fighter*.

I think that's enough information for you to get started. Is there anything else you'd like to know?
