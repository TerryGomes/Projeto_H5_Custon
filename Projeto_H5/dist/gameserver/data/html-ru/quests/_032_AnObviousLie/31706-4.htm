!Miki the Cat:

What are you talking about?

Are you saying *Gentler* told you to get the payment for the runestone from me? I never signed such a contract! Our agreement was that I would bring the herbs on time and he would pay me for them.

He probably thought he wouldn't see me again because I wander about so much. Go back to *Gentler* and get the reward from him!
