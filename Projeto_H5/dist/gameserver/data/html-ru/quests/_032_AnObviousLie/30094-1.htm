If you can find him for me, I'll give you a great reward.

Actually, *Miki the cat* gets lost easily, so I got him a map, but he forgot it.

Last I heard from him he was at the *entrance to Devil's Isle*. He went to get some other herbs, and hasn't been back. If you see him, give him this map and bring me the herbs!
