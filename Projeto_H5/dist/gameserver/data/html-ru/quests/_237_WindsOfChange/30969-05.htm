!Iason Heine:

As you probably know, I am a busy man. And I don't have the time to address this particular matter personally.
 So I want you to decide who I should support. Go meet with the supporters of both sides, listen to their opinions and report back to me.

First, I'll set up a meeting with Head Blacksmith Roman who happens to be a supporter of Dr. Helvetica.
 After that, you'll have a meeting with High Priestess Morelyn who supports this Athenia woman.

After you have meet with these two, come back to me with your decision.
