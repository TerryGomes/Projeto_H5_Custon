!High Priestess Morelyn:

Nature is the lifeblood of everyone and everything.
 The land will only nurture us so long as we nurture it.
 Athenia understands this and strives protect this delicate balance.
 And she is willing to do that by any means necessary.
 And for that, she has my unwaivering support.
