!Head Blacksmith Roman:

I'm serious as the grave.

What good is that land doing completely undeveloped? Does that reed field make money? Is it benefiting anybody at all?

Dr. Helvetica just wants to ulitize the land... give it a purpose. Developing on that land won't just make him money, it will make money for us all. Can't you see that?

The day that Athenia's plan puts adena in my pocket will be the day that I re-evaluate my decision. But until that time, my patronage goes to Helvetica. Ponder that on your way out.
