!Master Digler:

To get the Resonance Amulet, there are two ways.%%
One way is to defeat the *Demon Halisha,* who is located within *the Four Sepulchers.* you must form a party to enter.
If that proves too difficult, defeat the followers of Halisha at the *Shrine of Loyalty.* By doing so, you can earn "tickets." Once you have acquired over *700* tickets, Halisha himself will appear. By the way, the creatures you must face are the *Grave Scarab, Scavenger Scarab, Grave Ant, Scavenger Ant, Shrine Knight and Stander.*
