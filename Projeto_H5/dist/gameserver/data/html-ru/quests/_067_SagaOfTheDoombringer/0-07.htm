!Hierarch Kekropus:

That is indeed the substance of the "Forgotten History." We were living weapons, beings created by the Giants to battle the gods themselves. Released from the restraints of the gods, the Kamael could not be ruled by them.%%
But remember, our history is just that: history. The Giants are long vanished, and we must now chart our own path through this chaotic era. In the near future, you will be forced to choose whether to wield Enuma Elish
against the gods, or if there is another purpose for the sword.%%
I have faith that you will choose wisely, Doombringer.
