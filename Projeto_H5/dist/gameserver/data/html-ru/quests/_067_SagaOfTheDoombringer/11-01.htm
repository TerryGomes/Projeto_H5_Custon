!Master Digler:

You have returned! How was your encounter with the Tablet of Vision? While you were gone, some of the other masters and I have been investigating the strange happenings. We suspect that there is definitely someone working against the power of Enuma Elish. We do not know his identity, but we think he might be planning to exterminate anything related to Enuma Elish. I am especially worried for Harkilgamed, the last of our kind to take over the stone, who is already in hiding. Not only has he wielded the sword, he even knows its location. As for you, do not relax your guard during this quest!%%
Ah! We must talk about the amulet. I have it, but I cannot give it to you at this time.
