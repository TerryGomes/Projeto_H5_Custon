!Hierarch Kekropus:

Then you must embark upon a journey to unleash your sealed power. Scattered throughout the world there are magical objects that can help%%
unlock your potential called Tablets of Vision. These *6* Tablets of Vision should provide you the insight%%
necessary to break the seal. Visit *Master Duroga in the Town of Aden.* He will give you additional details.%%
On this quest, you will also likely encounter the Guard of Vision, Eranude, who is a kind of watchman for the Tablets of Vision. His task%%
is to test the individuals who approach the Tablets of Vision to ensure they are worthy to communicate with the objects.%%
Approach him with great care!
