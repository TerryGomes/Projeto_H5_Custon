!Master Digler:

In order to renew the power of the damaged amulet, we need the Divine Stone of Wisdom and its strong spiritual power.%%
That stone is possessed by two great magicians: the Soul Guide Asefa of the Ketra Orcs and the Soul Guide Udan Mardui of the Varka Silenos.%%
They will award the stone to the most intelligent ones among their kind. If you can gain eithers' trust and prove your worthiness, they will give you the stone.%%
There is no other way than to obtain the Divine Stone of Wisdom other than from them. What will you do?
