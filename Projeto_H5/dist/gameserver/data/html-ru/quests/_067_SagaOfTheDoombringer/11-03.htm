!Master Digler:

We must have this amulet to attract the opponents who are interested in Enuma Elish. Fortunately, it can be obtained through other means...%%
One way is to defeat the *Demon Halisha,* who is located within *the Four Sepulchers.* you must form a party to enter.%%
If that proves too difficult, defeat the followers of Halisha at the *Shrine of Loyalty.* By doing so, you can earn "tickets." Once you have acquired over *700* tickets, Halisha himself will appear. By the way, the creatures you must face are the *Grave Scarab, Scavenger Scarab, Grave Ant, Scavenger Ant, Shrine Knight and Stander.*
