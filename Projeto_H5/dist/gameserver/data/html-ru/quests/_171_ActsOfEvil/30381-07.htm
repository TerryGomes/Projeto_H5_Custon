!Guard Alvah:

A Contract? What's this? Hmmm, a Contract to purchase a large supplies of weapons. Look at this seal at the bottom! The mark of a Dwarven Guild! Could this be the proof we need that Dwarves are providing ol mahums with weapons?

We must find out which guild uses this seal, but we can't ask the Dwarves directly...

Have you met *Neti*, who lives in this village? Ask her! She used to live among the Dwarves in Schuttgart and knows their ways.
