!Guard Alvah:

What's that? Ol mahums in the Orc Barracks...? Certainly this proves they are planning an attack! This is most distressing!

... I fear this still won't be enough to persuade Sir Klaus Vasper. We must try to get more information from the patrols that were sent to spy on the ol mahums... They were last known to be hiding from the ol mahums in the *Ruins of Agony*. I fear they may have been killed by the *Tumran bugbears* that roam that desolate place...

Please find out what has become of our patrols. This is of utmost importance! I must know what happened to them!
