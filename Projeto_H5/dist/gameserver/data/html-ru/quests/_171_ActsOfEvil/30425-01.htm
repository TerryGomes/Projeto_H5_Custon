I have a basic idea of your situation... Could I take a look at the Contract?
This is the mark of the Silver Scale guild. *Trader Rolento* is the only Dwarf in this area who belongs to that guild... However, he would never supply weapons to the ol mahums...

I'm sure there must have been a misunderstanding! Or, maybe someone framed him... If you met him you would realize that I know what I'm talking about. Please! Go and meet Rolento at the *south entrance of the Wasteland*, you'll realize he would never have done such a thing.
