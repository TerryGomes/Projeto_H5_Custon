Please do what you can to clear *Trader Rolento's* name as soon as possible. It Is just appalling that a man of his character could have such scurrilous rumors circulated about him! He would never have supplied weapons to the ol mahums!

Please, go to the *south entrance of the Wasteland* and meet Rolento.
