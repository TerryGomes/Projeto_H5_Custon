!Turek Chief Burai:

Good job! 30 good ol mahums!

This is just the beginning of the carnage! They shall rue the day they deceived us! We will attack their barracks at dawn and give no quarter!

Go to Gludin and tell them that they are off the hook... For now. One day the mighty Turek tribe will sweep down like a black cloud and destroy them!
