!Gatekeeper Roxxy:

I'm very fortunate to have a job that allows me to travel across the continent.

How many others can say they've seen the grandeur of Aden Castle or visited Giran's bustling markets or watched the sun set over the waters of Heine?

Perhaps one day you will be able to see these things for yourself!

(Only Humans who are level 3 or above may undertake this quest.)
