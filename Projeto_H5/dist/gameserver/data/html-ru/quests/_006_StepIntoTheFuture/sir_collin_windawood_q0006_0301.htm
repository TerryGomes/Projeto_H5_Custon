Want to go to Giran, huh? Baulo sent you? I told him the story a while back.

You may be fresh out of school, but worldly experiences will help shape your future.

Giran is a busy place and unexpected things can happen, so stay calm and focused!

Meet *Gatekeeper Roxxy* and tell her I sent you. Good luck!
