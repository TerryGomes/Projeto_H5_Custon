Hmmm... I see. It is certainly expensive to travel to the mainland, especially to a place as far away as Giran.

But I think it would be an invaluable experience for you. When I was about your age, I had the opportunity to spend some time abroad, and it did me a world of good. I have an idea! *Sir Colin Windawood* is looking for young people with ambition and potential -- I think you would be ideal.

Take this *letter* to Sir Colin and tell him you are there at my recommendation. I'm sure he will cover your travel expenses.

Sir Colin loves to explore the ancient ruins of our island, so don't expect to find him in his office. I've heard that he's been spending a great deal of time at the *Obelisk of Victory*, so check there first. Good luck!
