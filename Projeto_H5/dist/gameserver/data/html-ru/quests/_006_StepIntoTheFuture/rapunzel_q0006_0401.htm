!Gatekeeper Roxxy:

How wonderful for you! Both Baulro and Sir Colin are such helpful people that I'm not surprised.

Here is a special Scroll of Escape capable of opening a Dimensional Door to Giran. *Pay close attention: it can only be used once! Use it like any other Scroll of Escape. Here as well is the Mark of the Traveler* that Sir Colin asked be prepared for you. When you are ready to return to Talking Island, show it to *Trader Galladucci at the luxury store in Giran* and he will help you. I should warn you that he's a little peculiar, but he knows his business inside and out.

May your journey be filled with adventure and excitement!
