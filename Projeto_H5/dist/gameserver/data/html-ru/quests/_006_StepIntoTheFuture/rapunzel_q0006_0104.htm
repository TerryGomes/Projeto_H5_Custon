Oh, I hope I didn't give you the wrong impression! Traveling to Giran from here is very, very expensive! I doubt you could afford it...

But perhaps there is another way.

Speak with *Magister Baulro* at the Temple of Einhasad. He's always happy to meet students from Talking Island; if you're very polite, perhaps he will even help you reach Giran!
