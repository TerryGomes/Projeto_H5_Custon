!Gatekeeper Roxxy:

I'm very fortunate to have a job that allows me to travel across the continent.

How many others can say they've seen the grandeur of Aden Castle or visited Giran's bustling markets or watched the sun set over the waters of Heine?

Despite my love of travel, though, I was happy to return home here to Talking Island...at least for now. I must admit that I do miss the night life in Giran!
