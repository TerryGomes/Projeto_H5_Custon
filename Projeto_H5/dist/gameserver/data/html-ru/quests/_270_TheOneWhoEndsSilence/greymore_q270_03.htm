!Priest Greymore:

Finally, we'll be able to cleanse this place of these filthy monks. I can see it in your eyes, you want it as much as I do. And I can tell you, I REALLY do. These fools will know fear before the day is over. You must defeat them for me.

All monks in the monastery, I am not picky about who. <font color="LEVEL">Seeker Solina, Savior Solina, Ascetic Solina, Divinity Judge, Divinity Manager, Divinity Worshipper, Divinity Protector, Divinity Fighter, Divinity Magus... </font>any of them. Defeat as many as you can. As proof... hmm... bring me their <font color="LEVEL">Monk's rags</font>. Yes, that will be perfect.
