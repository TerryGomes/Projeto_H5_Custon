!Oracle Captain John:

Oh! Begs your pardon, just we get lots of vagrants and the like round here, see? Terribly sorry if I caused offense--wasn't my intention, 'specially not after Lady Claudia was so generous with that... donation... of hers.

Here you are--that card'll get you into the Sanctum faster than a ferret on fire, just you see!

Oh! 'fore you go, there's a message the good lady asked me to pass on. Wants you to go see <font color="LEVEL">Bishop Raymond</font> in the <font color="LEVEL">Temple of Einhasad</font>, said it's important.
