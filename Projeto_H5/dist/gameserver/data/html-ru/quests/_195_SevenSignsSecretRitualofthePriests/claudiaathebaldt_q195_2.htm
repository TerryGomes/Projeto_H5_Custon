!Lady Claudia:

Yes, the old fashioned way too--bribery!

I've paid off one of the guards of the Sanctum, <font color="LEVEL">Captain John</font>. He's fabricated a new card for you, and should be waiting for you right now in <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>.

If you hurry he'll still be there by the time you arrive. Go!
