!Warehouse Keeper Parman:

If you go *northwest of Gludio* there is a farmer who sews the seeds and cultivates the land despite the rampage the Orcs are making. His name is *Peter* by the way? You'd better go and ask him about the *Token of the Fertile Lands* since he is the man who cultivated the Wastelands which everybody abandoned.
