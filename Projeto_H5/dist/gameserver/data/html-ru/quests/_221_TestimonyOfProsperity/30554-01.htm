Gosh, who the hell is this?! Long time no see! It seems like only a few days ago when you hunted those bearded keltirs around here, and look at you! You have grown so much! Cool! You look really great! You want know how I could recognize you, right? Well, as for me, I remember every single union member's face that went through here!

By the way, what is your reason for visiting me? Donation? What do you mean? I remember that I already gave it exactly 13 days ago! Did you say I didn't? Are you doubting my memory?! Go and check with *Elder Filaur*. I even have a receipt here with me! I have no intention to give donations twice so you'd better go and check again!
