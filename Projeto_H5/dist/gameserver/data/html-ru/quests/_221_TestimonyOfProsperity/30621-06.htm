!Maestro Nikola:

Great! you have made a copy of the keyhole! Well done! Now please have a little more patience. I will soon write down the *recipe for the key*. Now... let me see... Shall we get started on making a map of the key's structure? Hmmm...I see that it is a very complicated structure in which many different triple spirals are layered and connected with another double spiral. Fantastic, fantastic...I have never seen such a thing. But it's still only a piece of cake for me, Maestro Nicholas!

Now! It's done. *I assure you 100% that you will be able to open the box if you follow the recipe*. Just collect the materials as it says in the recipe. I will give you the details on what creatures you'll have to hunt, also. You'll be able to find everything in the Cruma Marshlands,so don't worry. I bet you can manage this, right? Now if everything is clear, get started!
