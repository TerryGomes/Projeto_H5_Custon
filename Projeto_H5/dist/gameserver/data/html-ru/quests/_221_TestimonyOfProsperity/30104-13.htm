!Warehouse Keeper Parman:

This is indeed Maphr's Tablet! It is surprising that you found a fragment of the original even though it is just a small part. Incredible indeed! I knew you could make it. Good job! The Elders will also be very happy about it. I will give a detailed presentation to the Elders on your achievements. By the way, between you and me, I heard that recently there has been another discovery of fragment. Including what you have found out, it will dramatically affect the process in the research on absolute geometry.

Now we have to send this Maphr's Tablet fragment to the village of Dwarves. Only the Elders can decipher the Giants' characters written on the stone slate. People like me can't understand a single word of it. That is because the knowledge of deciphering the Giant's characters are only handed down among the Elders...

Congratulations! By this you have passed the second level of the test! Now that you have completed your task successfully, I shall give you the *Mark of Prosperity*. From now on, work even harder to promote to the upper level union member. May the rich blessings of Maphr accompany you on your way!
