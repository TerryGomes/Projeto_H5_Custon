Yes, it is only the thought that counts. There is one thing that my mother loves, now that I think about it. It is a *bouquet made from mandragora petals*. I don't know the story behind it, but she always seems quietly happy whenever I give her that bouquet.

I will create one for you to give her if you will bring me the materials. I will need *20 mandragora flower petals* and *10 bunches of crimson moss*. You can get the petals from the *mandragoras* plants that grow on the western part of the execution grounds. The moss can be found near the *crimson ants of the Cruma marshlands*. Good luck on your journey!
