Hope..., Yes, I suppose there is hope after all...

These days the hired troops are taking care of the Orcs while my brothers and I work day and night to reclaim the land. Someday this farm will boast the richest land in the kingdom of Aden!

So you seek the *Token of the Fertile Lands*? Then you shall have it. I was given this from another Dwarf.  He appeared at a time when I had just come to this barren land and was having no luck growing crops. He gave me a seed and said that *the blessings of Maphr were within it*.

When I planted this seed it enriched the soil and my harvests have been improving steadily since then. I put back some of the seeds and have saved them until this day.  Now I shall share the seeds with you. This gift from one Dwarf I now give to another.
