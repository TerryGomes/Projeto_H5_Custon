!First Elder Lockirin:

To a Dwarf, nothing in the world is more important than wealth. We serve the God Maphr because it is he from whom flows all wealth and abundance. Please don't misunderstand me, I mean no disrespect.

My race possesses unfathomable wealth. Personally I could well afford a human estate. In spite of our embarrassment of riches, my race is still unsatisfied...

If we could just get our hands on all of the fragments of Maphr's Tablet, we could buy the entire continent...our wealth would finally eclipse that of the humans! Only Maphr knows if I shall live to see this come to pass...

Oh, pardon the idle musings of an old man. We have business to discuss. Let's talk about that Mark of Wealth that you are looking for. I would be happy to oblige, if only you would run a *simple errand* for me. Is this acceptable?
