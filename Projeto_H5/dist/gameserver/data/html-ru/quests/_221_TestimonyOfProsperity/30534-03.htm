Hmm.... A piece of paper in lieu of payment? Another one of Torocco's tricks? Let me see... 'The bearer of this document hereby agrees to pay the Bronze Key Guild dues in place of Carrier Torocco.' Hmm...

How generous of you! Offering to pay dues in place of that rascal. Well, I have no complaints as long as the dues are paid. I understand. You may make the payment for him.
