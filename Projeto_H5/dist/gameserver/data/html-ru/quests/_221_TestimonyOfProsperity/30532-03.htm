!Elder Spiron:

Thank you very much. With this payment all of our members have paid their dues. Here is the *receipt*. Please take this to First Elder Lockirin.

I hear Cha-Li's business is not doing so well. I wonder how he managed to pay his dues...? What? He went into debt to make this payment? My my! I didn't know his financial status was that bad! I'll help him this time. I cannot ignore the troubles of a fellow guild member. I'll make his payment for him, and return his money. Good job, you can be on your way. I'll take care of the rest.
