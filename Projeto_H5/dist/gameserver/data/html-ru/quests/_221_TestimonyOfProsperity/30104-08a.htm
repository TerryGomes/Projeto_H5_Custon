Well, the absolute geometry is a field of study which was made a long time ago, around the era of myths, by Maphr.  It is the ultimate study which contains everything about the fundamental elements of what this universe consists of, and the principle power that makes nature function. That is why they say that *he who can understand the absolute geometry can get hold of world power*.

Our ancestors devoted themselves in the study of absolute geometry, and established the academic system and technology of mathematics, dynamics, measurement, architecture, astronomy, navigation and economics. Through this knowledge and technologies derived from absolute geometry, we could build great architecture such as the sky garden of shootguart, and the great palace of Harnark as well as develop the concept of monetary economy in place of  the barter system, and come up with warrior golems and such.

But ever since the downfall of Giants, most of the systems in absolute geometry has been lost. It is a pity indeed...
