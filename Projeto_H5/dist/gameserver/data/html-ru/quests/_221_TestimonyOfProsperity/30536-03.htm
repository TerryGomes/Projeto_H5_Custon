!Elder Arin:

Phew!. Ah, the guild dues of *Master Toma*! So, how was he? Enraged? Yes, I thought he might be. He is one strange duck, that for sure. He looked down on me when I was a child, and still treats me like one, even though I am an Elder now...

Anyway, I am glad it worked out. I'm sure that there would have been a greater fuss if I had personally gone myself. Thank you.

Please take this *receipt* and deliver it to First Elder Lockirin.
