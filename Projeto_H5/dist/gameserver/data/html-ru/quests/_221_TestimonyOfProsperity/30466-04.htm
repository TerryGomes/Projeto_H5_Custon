!Guard Bright:

Do you remember all the materials needed for the bouquet?

*20 mandragora flower petals* and *10 bunches of crimson moss*. You may acquire the petals from the *mandragoras* that grow on the west parts of the execution grounds, and the moss is found near the *crimson ants of the Cruma marshlands*. Good luck, then. I hope to make the bouquet soon and see my mother smile.
