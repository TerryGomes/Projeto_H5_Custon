!Elder Spiron:

May you be blessed with wealth and the virtue of generosity! I am Spiron, the Chief Elder of the Golden Wheel Guild.

Ah! I remember you. Did you not rid us of the goblin brigand? Though my memory has faded somewhat... You have grown much since I last saw you.

So, you have come to collect guild dues on behalf of the First Elder? Let's have a look at the delinquent payments... Oh! I see *Trader Charly of the weapons shop* has not yet made his payment. I hear business has been bad since travelers have started to trade among themselves... I guess his financial worries are as bad as they say...

Go to Charly and collect his dues, and then return with his payment.
