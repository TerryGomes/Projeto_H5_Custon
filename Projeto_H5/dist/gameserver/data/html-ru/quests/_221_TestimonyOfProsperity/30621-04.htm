!Maestro Nikola:

We figured out about the key's material. The problem is the keyhole shape. I need your help in that area. Thank you. Please enter the tower and copy the pattern of the keyhole! If we have the *copy of the keyhole*we can write down the recipe for making the key.

Now! Take this clay dough. With the dough, copy and bring the pattern of the keyhole.
