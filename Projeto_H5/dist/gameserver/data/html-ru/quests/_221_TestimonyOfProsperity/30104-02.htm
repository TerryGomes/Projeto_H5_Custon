!Warehouse Keeper Parman:

You are already getting lazy after passing the member's trial! You, shouldn't you start preparing to be an upper level member of the union? How about a Master Raider or a Warsmith?

What do you think? Does that interest you? Keep this in mind. In order to be an upper level member, you must pass the *Test of Prosperity*. It is no match to the member's trial. You are too inexperienced to take this test yet. Come back after you have gathered more experience. Then I shall tell you in detail about the test.

(Quest for Dwarven characters of level 37 and above.)
