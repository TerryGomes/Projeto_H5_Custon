!Warehouse Keeper Parman:

You are already getting lazy after passing the member's trial! You, shouldn't you start preparing to be an upper level member of the union? How about a Master Raider or a Warsmith?

What do you think? Does that interest you? Keep this in mind. In order to be an upper level member, you must pass the *Test of Prosperity*. It is no match to the member's trial. But I think you are experienced enough to take the test...
