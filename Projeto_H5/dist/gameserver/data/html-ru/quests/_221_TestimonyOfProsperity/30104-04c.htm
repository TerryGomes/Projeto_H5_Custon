!Warehouse Keeper Parman:

I heard this when I was in the *Dion Castle Town*. In that village there was a woman who gave birth to 12 children and raised them all by herself. For that reason, she is called *'The great mother'*. Isn't it amazing, that a woman could give birth to 12 children and raise them all by herself?

I bet there would be no greater expert than her in *fertility*. What do you think? Will you try to go and see her? I don't know her name exactly, though. All I know is that she is called the 'Great mother'. I heard that  *one of her sons is a guard* of the village...
