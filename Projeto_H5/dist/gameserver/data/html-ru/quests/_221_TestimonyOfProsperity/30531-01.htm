!First Elder Lockirin:

Many years have passed since you left for the mainland. So, how are you? Have you managed to earn some money?

Ah, yes, The Test of Prosperity.  It is gratifying to see ambition in one so young...I suppose Parman told you that I am the one to see if you want the *Mark of Wealth*. I, First Elder Lockirin, Leader of the Dwarves, am he who holds the economy of the land in his grasp!
