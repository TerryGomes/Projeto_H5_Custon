An Elf more than 1,000 years old...? Yes, that's right! You mean *Lilith*.  Yes, she didn't just live for more than a thousand years, she has been waiting for her lover for over 1,000 years. So that means that she must be well over 1,000 years.

I don't know if that means for an Elf, 1,000 years is not a very long time, or if she loved her lover that much.

You should go and see Lilith for yourself. You can find her in the *temple of this town*. She looked quite gloomy these days, how about bringing her this brooch as a present? It might cheer her up since Elves adore pretty ornaments.
