!Warehouse Keeper Parman:

This is the story that I heard from Wilfred the Warehouse Keeper of Talking Island. It is said that there is an Elf who has been *waiting for his lover to come back for 1,000 years*. Isn't that amazing? That he lived for one thousand years. It reminded me of him when we were talking about *health*.

Aren't you curious? How he could live for such a long time? Even though the life span of an Elf is much longer than that of any other, I have heard of no Elf that could live for 1,000 years before. Anyway, go to the *Warehouse Keeper Wilfred of Talking Island * and ask him about the Elf that lived for more than a thousand years.
