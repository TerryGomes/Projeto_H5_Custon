!Warehouse Keeper Parman:

Recently, we obtained some information on an ancient relic which is thought to be a part of Maphr's Tablet. Considering that the tablet was made during the era of the Giants, it is very likely that it will be somewhere among the Giants' Ruins. *The investigation team that was exploring the relics of the Cruma Tower has reported that they have discovered a box in which they think that the fragments of Maphr's Tablet are contained.*

 Your task is to go to the site and collect Maphr's Tablet fragment! It will be a very dangerous task. First go and meet *Maestro Nikola*, who is stationed there. You will most likely be able to meet him near the *entrance of the Cruma Tower*. He will fill you in on the details.
