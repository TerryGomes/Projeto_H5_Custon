!Maryse Redbonnet:

What? Did you say *donation?* All that I can think of now is that God damn wolf! Nothing, not to mention donations, can stop me from my revenge.

Fine, if you can help me with my revenge, I will give you as large a donation as you want. Gather *100 pieces of Animal Skin* and bring them to me!

(The Animal Skin is an item needed in production.)
