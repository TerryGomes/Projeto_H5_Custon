!Elder Filaur:

May the blessings of the rich earth be with you.  You have come to collect the dues in place of the First Elder? But... You look strangely familiar... Let me see... Yes! Aren't you the one that helped me find the map of the hidden vein?  It's been too long! I am glad to see you again. So, how is life treating you these days? Have you managed to earn some money?

Oh yes! Right...I should not waste my time like this! Gossiping while you have so many things to do. Let me see, who has not paid his dues... Oh my! *Miner Bolter* has not yet paid. Strange that a diligent Dwarf like him has not paid. Go to him and find out why.
