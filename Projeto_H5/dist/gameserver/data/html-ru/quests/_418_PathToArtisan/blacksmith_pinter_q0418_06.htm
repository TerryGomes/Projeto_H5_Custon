Compensation ... right. Dwarves do not operate without something in return ... Hmm, what would you like?

Ah, you are in the midst of taking the test of the Artisan, aren't you? If that is so, then I will give you this. However, you must not tell anyone what you have done. If this becomes known, we could all be permanently removed from the Black Anvil Guild.

Well then, please take this box back to *Kluto*. Thank you.
