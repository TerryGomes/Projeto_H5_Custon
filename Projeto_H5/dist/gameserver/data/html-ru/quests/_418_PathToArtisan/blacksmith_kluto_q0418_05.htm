!Blacksmith Kluto:

Ah, look at myself. I said something unnecessary. My apologies.

But it seems you have quite a strong character. Actually, all that I said was simply to test your qualifications. You have passed, for now. I see you are a fine Dwarf. It is an unwritten law that we Dwarves do not put our efforts into something that is unprofitable, and I can see that you have some talent!

But ... There is something I must confess ... There is a bit of a problem ... You cannot take a test in these circumstances ... What should I do ...?
