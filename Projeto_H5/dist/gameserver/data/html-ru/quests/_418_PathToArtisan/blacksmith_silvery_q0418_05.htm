!Blacksmith Silvery:

Oh, fine, fine!  I see that you are ready for the Artisan test.

It is administered by the guild master of the Black Anvil, of whom you have certainly heard - a blacksmith of great renown! I will give the first, most basic of the tests; if you pass, you may go on to the second test.

Shall we begin?
