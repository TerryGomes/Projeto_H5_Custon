!Blacksmith Kluto:

Ha Ha Ha, with this, you have passed the final test. Congratulations! Are you confused?

I was testing your loyalty to see if you would keep a secret until the last moment. All that you have done until now was actually part of the test. The box that you brought is in fact just an empty box. I am sorry if I seemed like I was tricking you for a while, but this is how we Dwarves give our tests. "Always pursue profit" and "Never betray your colleague in a crisis" are two very different proverbs, and it is difficult to live up to them both.

Since you have done both splendidly, I will give you the final certificate for passing the test of the Artisan. Now take this and go to *Head Blacksmith Tapoy* to change profession to an Artisan. Of course, you know the required level is 20, right?

If you understand, go on now and become an Artisan. From now on, we are colleagues!
