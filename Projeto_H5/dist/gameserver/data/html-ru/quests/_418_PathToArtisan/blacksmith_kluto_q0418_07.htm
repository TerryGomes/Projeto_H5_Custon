!Blacksmith Kluto:

Thank you, youngster. So, from now on I want you to listen carefully to what I say.

Take this letter that I give you to *Blacksmith Pinter in the town of Gludio*. If you give him the letter, he will give you something. Bring that back to me. What do you think? It's very easy, isn't it?

Now that you know, depart quickly! Every moment is critical!
