!Guard Stan:

Smell that? Sweet salvation, that's what it smells like to me. Like a juicy slice of heaven, wrapped in honey by angels and turned into an aroma. Hm... I smell it every Thursday. Sadly, I've never tasted it. A lesser man would have gone mad by now. MAD I say!!

I don't know what it is, but they cook it over at the Sel Mahum Training Grounds. When I close my eyes I dream of this smell.
