!Gatekeeper Wirphy:

Most of my body parts were created by combining materials from the previous creations of the ancient giants.

But because the remains are not complete, I can always feel energy draining out of my body. My body could not be perfected with Dwarven technology, so they opted for a second choice -- rechargeable energy.

But I used too much energy while recently teleporting a large group of traders. Will you help me?
