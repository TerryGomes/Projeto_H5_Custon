!Gatekeeper Wirphy:

Thank you!

You are truly kind.

While travelling through the Spine Mine Field, you will see many *whinstone golems*, one of the legacies of the ancient giants, wandering around. Please collect *twenty starstones* from their bodies. That should be enough energy for now.

I don't have much, but I can give you a *gatekeeper's token* that lets you use the teleport service.

Good luck then!
