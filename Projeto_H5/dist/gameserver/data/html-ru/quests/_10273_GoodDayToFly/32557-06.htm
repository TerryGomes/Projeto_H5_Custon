You must select a type of Aurabird. There are two types to choose from.<br>
When the Aurabird was first created during the Age of the Giants, it is said they altered several species. However, only two types survived after the fall of the Giants.<br>
One is called the <font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Falcon</font>, which has a penchant for melee type attacks and flies very fast. The other is called the <font color="LEVEL">Aurabird Owl</font>, which leans more towards magic type attacks.The Aurabird Owl flies more slowly, but has easier maneuverability.<br>
Which type do you want to be transformed into?<br>
