!Jeweler Ellie:

Ah, very nice! One, two, three... 10 ore pieces! This should be enough. Now I'll get started!

With this oriharukon and silver, I'll make a very pretty... Oh no!

I'm sorry, we've got a problem! I was going to refine the ore so I could make a beautiful piece of jewelry, but I ran out of some materials I need! Will you help me? I can't leave the store, and there's no time to order them now.

I need *5 oriharukons, 500 units of silver and 150 thons*. I know it's a lot, but I've got to have them! Please hurry!
