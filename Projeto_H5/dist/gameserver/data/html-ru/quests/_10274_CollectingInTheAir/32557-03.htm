It would be easier if I went with you, but unfortunately I'm far too busy. I've prepared this <font color="LEVEL">Star Stone Collection Scroll</font> to help beginners like you. Use it near a target and you'll do fine. It's not cheap, though, so I hope you'll learn the collection skill while using it.<br>
Your task is to bring me 8 of the following Extracted Star Stones- either <font color="LEVEL">8 Extracted Coarse Red Star Stones, 8 Extracted Coarse Blue Star Stones, or 8 Extracted Coarse Green Star Stones</font> using the <font color="LEVEL">Star Stone Collection Scrolls</font>.<br>
These star stones can be found in the skies around the Keucereus Alliance Base and on the paths to the Seeds and the Aerial Cleft. Good luck!
