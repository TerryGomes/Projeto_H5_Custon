!Master Cobendell:

My friend, you have done well to return. Have you gathered all the dryad's tears? Ah, excellent.

Please wait a moment. All I need to do is add the dryad's tears to the mixture that I have prepared.

Here, I have created the five potions that are needed most immediately. Please deliver this to *Sentinel Knight Alberius*.
