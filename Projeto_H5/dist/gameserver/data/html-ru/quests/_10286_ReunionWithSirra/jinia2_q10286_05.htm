I finally thought we had accomplished our life-long dream... Sirra's betrayal surprised us all. She only wanted to defeat the Ice Queen so she could take her place...

But, we won't overlook the courage you've shown. Allow us a chance to properly show our gratitude. Why don't we go to Jinia Guild and conclude this later.
