!Sirra:

I have no hidden motive. You and I share a common goal. And THAT makes us partners. You are most honored by it... Have you figured out how to withstand her deadliest magic? As partners, I'll tell you. Use frozen core, and her eternal blizzard magic will feel like a slushy. Wait until Freya casts that magic, and then use the frozen core right away.

Well, those frozen cores I mentioned can make that deadly magic feel like a soft winter snow. Next time you fight her, wait until she tries to cast the spell and immediately use the frozen core when you start to feel the cold. Ah, I wish I could see the look on her face when her power proves useless. And that's how the Great Sirra will bring about the end of Freya's reign!
