Don't lose your faith in the goddess. Regardless of race or rank, Einhasad's light and healing magic is still very much present in our world.<br>
I do not know what happened between Einhasad and Emperor Schuneimann, but... <br>
It is my belief that it is not the goddess who is at fault for the misfortunes that have befallen her people; it is rather the fault of those who exploit her name for their own power and advancement.<br>
Go tell <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Sylvain</font> what I just told you.
