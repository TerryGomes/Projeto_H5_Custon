Ah, I see you have brought me a letter from Angus...<br>Let me see...<br>

<a action="bypass -h Quest _138_TempleChampionPart2 pupina_q0138_11.htm">"Every race has its own rituals and customs. As an adventurer all too familiar with death, Angus' sorrow touched me, as did his desire to lay the trainee's soul to rest. What I did in no way helped Shilen, but it did give a measure of peace to the dead man's friends. I would hope they would do the same for me."</a>
