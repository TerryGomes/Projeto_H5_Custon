It seems that Einhasad desperately wants to stop something...what exactly, we still don't know.<br>
Perhaps it has to do with the elimination of the followers of Shilen and the monsters spawned by the dark goddess...<br>
That makes sense, considering how harshly Emperor Schuneimann persecuted Dark Wizards, Shilen's disciples and the followers of Gran Kain. Interestingly, by the way, those persecutions began after his first miracle... Coincidence? I'm inclined to think not.<br>
My research is still in progress, so there are still many questions.<br>
But I was able to find some evidence that may show a linkage...<br>
