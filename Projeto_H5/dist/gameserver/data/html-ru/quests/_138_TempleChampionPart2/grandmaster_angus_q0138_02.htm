(Angus looks very sad...)<br><br>
Hmm...<br>
You wish to help me?<br>
Well then... One of the Dark Elven trainees was accidentally killed during an actual fighting drill in Death Pass.<br>
I am preparing a ritual that will permit his soul to return to Shilen in peace.<br>
I do this in accord with the customs of his people...<br>
To perform the ritual, however, we will need his belongings, which were lost in Death Pass.<br>
You belong to the Temple of Einhasad, do you not?<br>
Are you sure that you wish to provide aid to a follower of Shilen?<br>
