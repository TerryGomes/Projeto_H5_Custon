<html><body>Priestess Pupina:<br>
That is well and wisely said! Both your actions and your words prove that you are very different from those arrogant Temple priests, obessed with the letter of the law rather than its spirit.<br>
You have proved that you are indeed a reasonable person.<br>
I will write you the letter of recommendation. Show it to <font color="LEVEL">Preacher Sla</font> in the wilderness, and perhaps he will treat you as a friend.<br>
May the light of Einhasad shine upon your journey and guard you from every danger...
