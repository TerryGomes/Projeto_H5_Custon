The Varka Silenos are doomed, just fight a little longer! You must try harder! Attack them and bring back *400 badges of grunts, 400 badges of officers and 200 badges of captains*, as well as a *Totem of Wisdom*. The Totem of Wisdom can be obtained by fulfilling the *Slay the Enemy Commander* quest, a mission assigned by *Hierarch Kadun Zu Ketra*. We have faith in you!
