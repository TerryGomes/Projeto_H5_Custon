!Ketra's Messenger Wahkan:

You're the best friend the Ketra ever had! The more you fight for the Ketra, the more we will trust you.

Our war against the Varka Orcs continues. We must drive those revolting goat beards from the face of the earth! Kill *Varka Silenos great mystics, captains, grand seers, prophets, prophet's disciples, prophet's royal guards, chief magi and chief escorts*. Kill them all and take their badges as proof.

Bring back *300 badges of grunts, 200 badges of officers and 100 badges of captains*. Good luck, my friend!

*However, if you laid a hand on our Ketra Orcs in the middle, our confidence in you will fade away and our alliance with you will be destroyed!!!*
