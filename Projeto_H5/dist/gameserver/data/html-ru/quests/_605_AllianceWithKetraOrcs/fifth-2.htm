!Ketra's Messenger Wahkan:

WThis mission will earn you the Ketra's highest level of trust. This task will not be very difficult for the strong one like you. You must kill the Varka Silenos and bring us *400 badges of grunts, 400 badges of officers and 200 badges of captains* as well as the * Totem of Wisdom*. The Totem of Wisdom can be obtained by killing Mos, the commander of the Varkas, longtime scourge of the Ketras. However, you must speak with *Hierarch Kadun Zu Ketra* for more details on the quest, known as *Slay the Enemy Commander* before killing Mos! Go ahead! I have no doubt that you will prevail!

*However, if you laid a hand on our Ketra Orcs in the middle, our confidence in you will fade away and our alliance with you will be destroyed!!!*
