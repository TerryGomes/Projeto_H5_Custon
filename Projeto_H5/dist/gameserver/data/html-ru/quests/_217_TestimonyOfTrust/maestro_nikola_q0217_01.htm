!Maestro Nikola:

Hello! Help from anyone is welcomed.

Hidden away deep inside Cruma Tower is a mechanical brain known as the *Core*.

For thousands of years, this artifact of Giant high-level technology slept. Recently, whether of its own volition or someone else's, it awoke. It began controlling creatures' actions and threatening the lives of nearby residents. It has also had a terrible effect on the 'Black Anvil' Guild, who specialize in Giant technology.
