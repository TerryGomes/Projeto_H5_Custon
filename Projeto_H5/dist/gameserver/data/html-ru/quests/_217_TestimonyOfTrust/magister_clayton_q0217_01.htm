!Magister Clayton:

I don't understand why the Tetrarch ask an outsider like you to do this such a job. But I have never doubted Tetrarch Thifiell's wisdom and have carried out the rules with loyalty. Therefore, even though I don't really feel like it, I will help you. I will tell you the materials you must get from now on.

First, go to the Corridor of Death and gather the blood of *the guardian basilisk*. 10 bottles of blood is just enough for a *basilisk plasma*.

Also, from the Wasteland, gather 10 aphids which you will be able to obtain by killing the *soldier ants* If you do so, you'll be able to get the *honeydew*.

Last, from the Cruma marshland of Dion, catch *the swamp stakato*and gather 10 bottles of their body fluids. By doing so,*a stakato ichor *will be made. When these 3 things are ready bring them back to me.
