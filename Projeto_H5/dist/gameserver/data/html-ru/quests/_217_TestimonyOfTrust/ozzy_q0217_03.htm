!Hierarch Asterios:

In the Elven Forest, the spirits of the wind and the trees are becoming vicious. If we can ameliorate the leaders of these spirits we will probably be able to suppress this disturbance...

The Chief of the wind spirit lireins is called *Luell of Zephyr Winds*. You can meet her if you follow the *lireins*.

And the Chief of the tree spirits is called *Actea of Verdant Wilds*. You will find him if you hunt for the *dryads*...

I wish you success. May you have the blessing of the starlight.
