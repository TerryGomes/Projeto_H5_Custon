!High Priest Hollint:

Thank you. It is hard to determine from their response whether we have truly earned their trust, but this is an important first step towards establishing a better relationship.

Now it is time for you to attempt to recover the trust of the Orcs and Dwarves. First, meet with *Cardinal Seresin* of this town. He is one of many who are working to recover trust between the races. He will be helpful to you.
