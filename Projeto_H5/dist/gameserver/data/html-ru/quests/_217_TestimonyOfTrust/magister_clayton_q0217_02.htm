!Magister Clayton:

Please gather all 3 materials that I have told you. Should I explain one more time? I have noticed that your people tend to forget things easily because they are hot tempered.

Hunt *the guardian basilisk*from the Corridor of Death and collect 10 bottles of its blood.That will make *basilisk plasma*.

And from the Wastelands hunt *the soldier ant *and out of the 10 aphids you'll be able to get *honeydew*.

Last, from*the swamp stakato* of Cruma marshland gather 10 bottles of the creature's body fluid and you'll get*a stakato ichor*.
