!Maestro Nikola:

I want to find out the principle by which the Core controls the life forms. With your help, I might have a chance.

Among the range of life forms in Cruma Tower is *Porta*, which seems to be a kind of Golem. We Dwarves may not know much about Elven magic or spirits, but believe me when I tell you that we're the experts when it comes to "created beings" like Golems. If I can make a close analysis of the internal structure of Porta, I think I can divine its workings. In order to do this, however, I will need a Heartstone sample.

Will you do me this favor? Go into the Tower and bring me *1 Heartstone of Porta*.
