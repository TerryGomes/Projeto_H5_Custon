A promise of trust...? Oh really? First you brutalize us and drive us deep into these mountains...and now you want our cooperation?... Your race deserves the reputation for knavishness that the humans ascribe to ours!

I'm sure you've heard the rumor that Dwarves only care about money.  Well its true.

 If you'll do something for us, we'll give you your promise of trust.
