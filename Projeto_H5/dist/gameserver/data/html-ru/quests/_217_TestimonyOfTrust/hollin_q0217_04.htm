!High Priest Hollint:

I understand your decision. May the light of Einhasad guide you. 

Now listen carefully to my words. A great danger looms in our future. Magisters have deciphered ill omens from the stars and the whispered messages of the elementals.

A growing tension between extremists from all races have made a chaotic future inevitable.

To survive the upcoming *chaotic chronicles*, we must earn the trust of other races and combine our forces to stem the disaster. We have decided to send an envoy to leaders of each race in order to regain their trust.  This plan has been approved by the highest level of government. This is the *Testimony of Trust* that we must now ask you to fulfill. Please represent our race as envoy to the leaders of all the other races, and extract a promise of trust from each of them.

First take these letters to the leaders of the Elf and Dark Elf races. Your first meeting should be with *Elven Hierarch Asterios*.
