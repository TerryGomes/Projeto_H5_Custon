!Tetrarch Thifiell:

Good job. You have been of great help in our efforts to free Mitraell, our tribal leader. *Take this letter.* It indicates that we have accepted the Humans' request and have agreed upon the need for trust between our races to deal with the upcoming *Chaotic Chronicle*.

This is only the beginning of the restoration of our trust. Time will tell if our trust in each other can continue. Now return to your King.
