!Priest Bandellos:

This case is going in the wrong direction. I think we need to send a special guard to protect her. And we'd better report this to the High Priest.

I heard your story from Master Sorius. He said that you were a great help in this case and praised you a lot.

In my mind as well, I think you have already proven that you are qualified. There might come a day when I shall need your help again... I hope you keep up with your practices for that day.

By the way... The thing that you are holding in your hands...It has been bothering me... It looks just like what we have lost in the church. Can I take a look at it?
