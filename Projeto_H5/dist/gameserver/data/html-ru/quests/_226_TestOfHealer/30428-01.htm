Oh, you mean the saintess? Of course, of course, if you are here to ask about the saintess, you have found the right person. I guess you are the one who was sent here as a representative of the shrine. I heard the news already. If you want, it is possible that I let you escort her to your place, besides having a meeting with her.

But, there is one condition... While we were searching for, and protecting the saintess ... we had quite a bit of expenses... I'm hoping that the shrine will compensate those expenses...? That is about *100,000 Adena*...
