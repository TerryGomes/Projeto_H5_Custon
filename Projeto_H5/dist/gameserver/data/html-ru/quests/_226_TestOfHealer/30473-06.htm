!Priest Bandellos:

This case is going in the wrong direction. I think we need to send a special guard to protect her. And we'd better report this to the High Priest.

I heard your story from Master Sorius. He said that you were a great help in this case and praised you a lot.

In my mind as well, I think you have already proven that you are qualified. I shall give you the *Mark of the Healer*. There might come a day when I shall need your help again... I hope you keep up with your practices for that day.
