Hmm...what does this say? 'Perform the ritual at the Obelisk of Shilen'.. I think they took the girl to *the obelisk in the Dark Forest.* Then the *Dark Elves* are involved in this case? Curse them! There are many obelisks in the Dark Forest... We can't figure out which obelisk they are at with only this?!

In any case, we have to track them as soon as possible. We must save the holy maiden before she becomes sacrificed. I am a Dwarf and slow on my feet, so you should leave first. I will send swift supporters to aid you, so hurry! They must be going to a place with an altar...! I will inform Sorius about the situation.
