!Mystery Dark Elf:

I carry out the will of Shilen. Those who dare to stand in my way will be brought down with no mercy!

I knew that you were tracking me... I suppose you are in the middle of the examination. So, does your future depend on capturing me? Ha! Who do I have to thank for this honor?

Sorry to say, but this is a matter of life and death for me as well. I won't make things too easy for you.

Soldiers, kill this man!
