!Chamberlain Brasseur:

An effective lord's rule depends not on force, but on the loyalty of his subjects. If you are to solidify your position, you must gain the support of the various local forces in the territory. I will investigate and inform you whom you should meet. Please wait, my lord, and I will return shortly.
