!Mysterious Wizard

The most important of the materials I need are undead hearts with their Human memory intact.

Especially the grey *heart of undead vampires*. They're just as good as red cloth from Aden. I need 200 of them.

Also, I'll trade you something for *undead brains*. You can hunt them at night. What do you think?
