Well, I like your can-do attitude! We'll gladly accept your help. We were supposed to received some construction materials, but they are long overdue. Something must have happened. We must find out what's happened, but I can't spare anyone to investigate. Most importantly, we need to resolve this problem quickly. Can you obtain the materials we need for our work? Then find out what happened to the materials that were supposed to arrive from Gludin.

We need 100 pieces of leather, 100 polishers, 100 iron ores and 50 cokes. Will you help us? There's no time to waste!
