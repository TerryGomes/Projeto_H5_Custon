!Chamberlain Saius:

I have been contacted by your representative, my lord. He says that we must determine the whereabouts of some freight Pinter and his men require for their reconstruction work, and then deliver it to them.

I have already asked Captain Bathis to look into the matter -- may I suggest that you and your followers locate alternate materials? Your personal involvement will make a powerful statement.
