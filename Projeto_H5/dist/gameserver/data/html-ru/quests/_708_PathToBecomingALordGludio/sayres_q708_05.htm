!Chamberlain Saius:

An excellent idea, my lord! Their leader is Blacksmith Pinter of the Town of Gludio. I'm sure he would be grateful for any assistance you can offer. In fact, you need not do it yourself. You can appoint a trusted agent to act on your behalf in this matter. Simply let me know whom you have chosen to Raffortysent you. If he agrees and you verify his identity, I will tell him what he needs to know.
