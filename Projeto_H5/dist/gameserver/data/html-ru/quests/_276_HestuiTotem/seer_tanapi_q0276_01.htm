!Seer Tanapi:

Young Orc, have you seen an animal called the *kasha bear*? It is a poor animal polluted by *kasha*, the evil spirit of death and decomposition. Animals polluted by evil spirits die slowly because of the curse. However, that is not the only problem. The curse is terrible because it can be spread to other animals.

The gray bears are the greatest guardian totems of the Hestui tribe. Our tribe has been consecrating the gray bears since ancient times. However, as gray bears recently became contaminated by the evil spirit kasha, the status of our tribe has been trampled to the ground, and not one day passes when we can sleep in peace.

We are working on purifying kasha bears, but I don't think you can take charge of this task yet.
