!Seer Tanapi:

If you kill a kasha bear, you must cut open its abdomen and take out the* kasha parasite*. The evil spirit kasha contaminates the gray bears through the parasites.

But the true enemy to defeat is the *kasha totem spirit*. They say that the evil kasha spirit takes the form of the gray bear. Based on my studies, *if there are enough parasites, they will call forth the kasha totem spirit.* I don't know how many are needed though.

If you kill the kasha totem spirit, the* crystal of the kasha totem spirit* will appear. Bring it to me. It is something I desperately need for my studies. If you bring it to me, I will reward you in the name of the Hestui. Good luck.
