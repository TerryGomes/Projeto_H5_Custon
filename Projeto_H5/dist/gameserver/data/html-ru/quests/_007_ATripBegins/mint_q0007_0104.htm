!Gatekeeper Mirabel:

Don't be foolish! You have no idea where you should go!

Experience is an excellent teacher, but she is also a harsh one. It will not be easy for you venture out from the protective shade of the World Tree.

If you are really serious about traveling to the outside world, ask a more experienced traveler like *Trader Ariel* for advice on how to prepare and what to expect.

Go talk to her.
