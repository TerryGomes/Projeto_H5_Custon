!Hierarch Asterios:

The outside world is a terribly chaotic place, nothing like our beautiful *Elven Forest*. Don't get me wrong, we have our share of problems, but nothing approaching the ravages that plague the world of the Humans.

But I've always said, "All young Elves should see *Giran Castle Town* at least once!" It's a Human village and an important travel hub. It's also a microcosm of the outside world and would be the perfect place for you to start your journey.

When you're ready to go, speak with *Gatekeeper Mirabel*. I'll ask her to help you.
