!Gatekeeper Mirabel:

Very well. Here is a *Scroll of Escape to the Town of Giran* as well a *Traveler's Mark*.

The Scroll can only be used once, remember! When you are ready to return to the Elven Village, visit Trader Galladucci and show him the Traveler's Mark.

A word of warning: Giran is a crowded and chaotic place, filled with all manner of scum and villainy.

Watch your back and your gold!
