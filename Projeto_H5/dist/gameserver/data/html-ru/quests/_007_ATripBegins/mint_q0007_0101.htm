!Gatekeeper Mirabel:

As much as I've traveled, even I can't claim to understand all the peoples in this wide world.

Our Elven Forest is a peaceful haven, but the outside world also has much to offer -- especially a bustling place like Giran.

Only through interacting with outsiders can we better understand not only this world, but ultimately ourselves.
