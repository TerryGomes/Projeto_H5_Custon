!Gatekeeper Mirabel:

As much as I've traveled, even I can't claim to understand all the peoples in this wide world.

Our Elven Forest is a peaceful haven, but the outside world also has much to offer -- especially a bustling place like Giran.

Perhaps one day you will be able to see it for yourself!

(Only Elves who are level 3 or above may undertake this quest.)
