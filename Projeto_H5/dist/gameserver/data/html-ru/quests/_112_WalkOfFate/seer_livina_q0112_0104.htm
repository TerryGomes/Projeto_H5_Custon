!Seer Livina:

Alas, fate isn't to be trifled with! To the east of here, there's a passage from the Cave of Trials to the Valley of the Lords. Take that passage towards the *Crypts of Disgrace* where the Orcs are buried. You'll meet someone named *Karuda*. Tell him to come to me and give me a status report!
