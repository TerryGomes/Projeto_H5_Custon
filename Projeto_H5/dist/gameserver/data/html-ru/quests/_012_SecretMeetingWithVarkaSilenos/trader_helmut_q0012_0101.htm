!Trader Helmut:

Did Guard Cadmon send you? All right. I guess you are good enough.

Bear in mind that the Varka Silenos are different from other Silenos. They may look alike, but the Varka Silenos have traditionally been fearless soldiers. They are completely different from other Silenos who are engaged in stock farming. They are very particular about manners. You should try not to offend them.

Okay, here's the task.  You need to take this box of supplies to the *Varka Silenos base*. Sounds simple, right?  Even a three year old can do this.
