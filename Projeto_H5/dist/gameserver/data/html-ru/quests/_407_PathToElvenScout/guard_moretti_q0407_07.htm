!Guard Moretti:

Ah, you have finally returned. Is Prias safe? What about his letter? Hmm...

Ah, I do not know whether my friend is truly courageous or merely rash. I can't believe he is staying behind to patrol. Anyway, he is very obliged to you. He may seem a little impolite on the outside, but he has a very kind heart. It's just that he is awkward when it comes to expressing his gratitude.

Now our guards must prepare and set off for the battle. We must teach the Ol Mahum stragglers a lesson. At any rate, your distinguished services have greatly helped this case. I have spoken to the captain of the guards and he has already prepared an *Honorary Guard*. If you take this to *Master Reisa*, you will be able to get what you want. Well, I have many things to prepare, so goodbye.
