!Master Reisa:

I see you have received an honorary guard certificate. I have already heard of your achievements. Guard Moretti highly praised you. Now I can gladly recommend you as an Elven Ranger. Who but a skilled Elf like you could become an Elven Ranger?

In the future, I hope you train still further, to become a magnificent Stealth Sentinel or Silver Ranger. Now take my recommendation and go to *Grand Master Rains*. He will change your profession to Elven Ranger. May the power of Eva be with you.
