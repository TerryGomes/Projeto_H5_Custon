!Sirra:

Don't fool yourself and pity Felicia. Yes, she was just a normal human once. But she was never innocent. She unabashedly sought more and more power, and to say she was self-centered is an understatement. We were all merely characters in her universe. When she absorbed the power of Freya from the crystal, it only accentuated her more vile personality traits and gave her power no mortal should possess. She has become not unlike a god herself.
