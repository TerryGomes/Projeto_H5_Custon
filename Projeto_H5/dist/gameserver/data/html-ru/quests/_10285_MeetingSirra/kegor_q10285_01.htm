!Kegor:

Again, thank you! Without you, we'd be in deeper trouble and I may very well have died. You are quite skilled... thank the Gods you are on our side! However, as skilled as you are, it isn't enough. In order to stop Freya, we'll need something of immense power that can absorb her power, such as the Divine Sword of Kier.

Kier used to be Princess Felicia's best friend and protector. The power of his sword was remarkable but not without danger. Over time, wielding it sapped my strength. I wandered around the Mithril Mines until I collapsed.
