!Investigator Laki:

At first glance, the Plain of Lizardmen is a beautiful world torn from a fantasy book. It's hard to believe the dangers that lurk there, until you see for yourself. These scars are my lesson to that reality, and my investigations are stalled because of it. Don't go unless you are more prepared.

(Only characters with levels of 82 or above, and completed the "Don't eat that recklessly" quest can play this quest)
