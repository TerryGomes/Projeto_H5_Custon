!Investigator Laki:

Primarily, I am investigating the intelligence of the Tanta Lizardmen, and whether or not they are cognitive enough to know how much they've changed to fit this new environment. The root of my research lies in the study of their blood... so much blood. But I've used it all and still my results are unsatisfying. Could you possibly gather more of the Tanta's blood for me? it's very important!
