!Investigator Laki:

If all you did was look from out here at the Plains of the Lizardmen, you'd describe it as a beautiful magical place. If only that were true. I was naive enough to believe that once, but the scars on my skin that I will leave here with will forever remind me of the truth. Look at this... and here... you see? That's from the poisons that cover the Plains. I'm just lucky to be alive. How can I study under these conditions?

Further, how does a species survive amidst the cursed magical energy that came from Antharas' blood that flows through the land? Not only survive... they seem to to actually thrive on the magic and poisons. That is the root of my research. How a species could adapt to that?
