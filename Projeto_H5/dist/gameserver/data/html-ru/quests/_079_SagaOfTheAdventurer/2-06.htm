Gulp! Gulp! Gulp!%%
You must be more capable than I thought, huh? Ha Ha Ha!%%
Now then, should I try to remember the old times?%%
Hmm... Let me see... The forbidden power was obtained by a strange hermit. It was taken away and divided by the gods. It is sealed up in several Tablets of Vision. In order to release the power that is bound in each tablet, you must have an object called a Stone of Commune. Each Tablet of Vision has its own individual Stone of Commune that it can communicate with!%%
Ah! Here it is. The first Stone of Commune.%%
Take this and use it to communicate with the first Tablet of Vision which is located on the south side of the Tower of Insolence.%%
I told you everything I know. So now, leave me in peace and go on your way.
