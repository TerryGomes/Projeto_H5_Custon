Beast Herder Tunatun:

Buy food from the Feed Sellers. Without food the beasts turn feral. If that happens you've wasted everyone's time. So do us both a favor, have enough food ready.

The cubs you can raise are *Alpine Buffalo, Alpine Grendel, Alpine Kookaburra, and Alpine Cougar*. So raise em' right. And when you do... bring me a Jewel of Innocence!
