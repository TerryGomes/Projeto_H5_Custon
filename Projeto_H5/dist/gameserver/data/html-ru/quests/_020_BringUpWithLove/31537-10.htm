Beast Herder Tunatun:

Now sometimes, and I do mean rarely, a cub remains purely innocent and good, without any trace of evil. Again, this is rare. But when it does happen, that cub will produce a white jewel.

We call this jewel a *Jewel of Innocence*. It's a product of the cub's pure love for its master.
