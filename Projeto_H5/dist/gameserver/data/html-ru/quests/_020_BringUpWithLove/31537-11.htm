Beast Herder Tunatun:

You've guessed it, I want that Jewel of Innocence! Beasts crave them, but only the person who raised the cub can retrieve the Jewel of Innocence.

Also, and I don't know why, but you only get one chance to acquire that jewel. I've only seen it once, truly unforgettable to say the least... 

Get this jewel for me and the reward will be great. What do you say?
