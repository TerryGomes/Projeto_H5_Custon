!Witch Athrea:

Okay.  You seem to be quick-witted enough.  Now I will go ahead and explain the test to you.

It is a very simple game.  You don't need to think of it as anything complicated. You already know what drawing lots is, right?  You can think of this as drawing boxes...?

First of all, I am going to summon 16 boxes by using magic. Among these boxes, four boxes are under a special magic spell and they shout words out when they are broken. What you guys have to do is to find all the boxes that are under the magic spell and break them all so that they will shout out words four times. Of course, if possible, you can break all the boxes.  However, since there is a time limitation you may not have enough time to break all the boxes. I set up the game in such a way so that if you cannot accomplish the task within the given time, all the boxes will disappear.

Well, then, shall we start the game?
