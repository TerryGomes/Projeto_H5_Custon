!Sir Kristof Rodemai:

What do you think of the current state of affairs? The royal authority at the center has been severely undermined to the point of losing its controlling power and revolts  are breaking out everywhere. Even the evil spirits are making sinister movements. When your clan becomes a little stronger, why donâ€™t you work with me to change the world!

(This quest can be carried out only by a level 3 clan.)
