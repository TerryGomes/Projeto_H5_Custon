!Witch Kalis:

Would you like to be a star that shines brightly in the midst of chaos? However, do you see these graves? These are the graves of those poor souls who have fallen while attempting to shine brightly.

Are you willing to take up the challenge of becoming a star even while risking your one and only life?
