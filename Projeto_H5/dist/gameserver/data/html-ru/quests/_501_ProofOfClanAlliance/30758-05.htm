!Witch Athrea:

Oh No! You didn't find any single one of the 4 Boxes! You failed! A complete failure!

Well, well, well. I can just coldly kick you guys out of here. But I'm too soft-hearted to do so. So, I am going to give you another chance to go take the test.

However... it's going to cost some money to make the boxes again, understand? If you pay 10,000 adena, I will make the boxes again, so that you can re-take the test.  What do you say?
