!Witch Kalis:

So, where is your confident attitude you exhibited earlier? I guess you haven't been able to find any clan members who are willing to sacrifice their lives?

I am telling you again. Unless you bring me back *three symbols of loyalty*, you will not pass the test. And in order to obtain the symbols, three of your clan members will make an oath of their life to the *table of sacrifice* and pledge loyalty to you.
