!Sir Kristof Rodemai:

I heard from my close associates that nowadays some vagabonds get together and claim to be a true clan.    You are not one of those vagabonds I hope? I cannot wait for you forever to be ready. If you cannot prove your capability, I'll have to go look elsewhere for another clan.
