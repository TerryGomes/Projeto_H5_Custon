!Witch Kalis:

Indeed! The fellows who are with you must have made a firm resolution that cannot be broken even by death. In this day and age when everybody is just motivated by their own profit, this is such a rare thing to see.

Then, this time why don't I ask you? Do you indeed have enough trust in your clan members? Can you bet your life on them? If you think so, drink this poison! And ask your clan members to make and bring back the antidote! Here, I wrote down all the ingredients that are needed to make the antidote. If your clan members can find and bring back all the ingredients within one hour, they can save your life.

Well, I wonder how hard will the clan members work to save your life? Why don't you wait and find out?
