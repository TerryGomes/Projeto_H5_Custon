!Sir Kristof Rodemai:

I think I picked a great partner. You and I belong to the same class of people…  We will become good friends. Of course it is possible that some day, we may end up being on opposing sides…  Until then, let’s enjoy each other’s company. Here, as promised, I’m giving you the Proof of Alliance.
