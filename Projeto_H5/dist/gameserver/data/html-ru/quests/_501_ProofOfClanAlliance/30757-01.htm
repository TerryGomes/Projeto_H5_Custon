!Statue of Offering:

Do you wish to take the test for the clan lord you are serving? I warn you. The moment you give your answer, you may lose your life.

Only the person who has made a firm resolution should come forward and answer my question.

Is your clan lord worthy of you risking your life? Is your loyalty more important than your own life?  Now, give me an answer!
