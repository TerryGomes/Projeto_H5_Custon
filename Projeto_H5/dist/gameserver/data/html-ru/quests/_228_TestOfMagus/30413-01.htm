!Water Undine:

I am *Undine*, the guardian of the deep lake, the spirit of the precious water... Did you come for the *Tone of Water*?

It is the rhythm which expresses the nature of water among the 4 basic elements which the world consists of... To make one of those, you need *20 Dazzling Drops* from the monsters of the marshlands.

Inpicioes which live in the *Cruma Marshlands*... And the *swamp stakatos* have the *Dazzling Drops*. If you can bring 20 of them, I shall make you the tone. This amulet is a voucher of promise...
