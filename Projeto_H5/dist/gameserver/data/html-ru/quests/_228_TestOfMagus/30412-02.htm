!Wind Sylph:

Yes. You are a wise man, indeed. Please find me these things. *20 Harpy Feathers*, *10 Wyrm Wingbone*, and *10 Windsus Manes*... You can get them all from the magic creatures in *Giran*.

Do you understand? The harpy which glides with the wind, the wyrm which makes a strong blast while it feathers, and the mane of the windsus blowing in the winds. All these materials are related to the wind, things which I need to control it...
