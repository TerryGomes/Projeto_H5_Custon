!Bard Rukal:

Good. First let me tell you something about myself.

My nights are sleepless, haunted by the songs of the spirits. This is a condition common to the practitioners of Elemental Magic.

This inhuman song is not of this earth, and can make the hair stand up on the back of your neck, and a cold shiver run down your spine.

You must find the source of this music. I know someone who can help you. I will introduce you to *Parina*, who is in the temple of *Gludin*. She has a profound knowledge of Elemental Magic.

She will help you find the source of this unworldly music if you show her this letter.
