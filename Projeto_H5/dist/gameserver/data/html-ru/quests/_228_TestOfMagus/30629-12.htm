!Bard Rukal:

Congratulations! You have passed the Test of the Magus! Now I can start the time-consuming process of creating Absolute Tone. This would not have been possible without your efforts. I will let you know when the Millennium Flowers bloom. Come to see me then.

Congratulations again on passing the test! I shall grant you the *Mark of the Magus*.
