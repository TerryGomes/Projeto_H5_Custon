!Bard Rukal:

Elemental magic is like a song from heaven. Combining the songs of the spirits is fundamental in the use of elememtal magic.

*Mystics* must have a complete understanding of the elements of tone.

The Test of the Magus will assess your understanding of the tones of the 4 elements. Those who pass this test will have a chance to advance to the higher level of Elemental Magic.
