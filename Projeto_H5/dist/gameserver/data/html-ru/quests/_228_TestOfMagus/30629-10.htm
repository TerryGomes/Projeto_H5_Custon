!Bard Rukal:

You must collect the 4 tones that correspond to the 4 elements in order to create an Absolute Tone. 

To obtain the *Note of Water* You must visit the *Water Undine*, a water spirit who lives in *Fellmere Lake*... It is located northwest of *Gludin*, north of the *Abandonded Camp*.

To obtain the *Note of Fire* you must seek the *Flame Salamander*.  Lizard spirits such as this salamander are formed with the power of flame.  They can be found in the *Ruins of Despair*, south of *Gludio Castle Town*.

To locate the *Note of Wind* you must meet the *Wind Sylph*. She is on the northwest side of the 3 entrances to the *Wastelands of Gludio*.

Last, the *Note of Earth* can be obtained from the *Earth Snake*. He is in the *Ruins of Agony*, on the north side of *Gludio Castle Town*.

I will give you a musical book in which to put the 4 notes.  When you have found them all return the book to me.
