!Wiseman Casian:

The *singing flowers* are said to root their *golden seed* near waterfalls or lakes, and seduce the stunned people with their beautiful voice. Two different kinds of singing flowers would never bloom close to each other.

*Perina*, *Rukal*... and I investigated its location and we managed to agree on a few places. Those places are, the *Fellmere Lake in Gludio*, the waterfalls near the *Ivory Tower of Oren*, and somewhere in the southern part of *Giran Castle Town*. 

Did you get it? The *singing flowers* are bound to gather around the watery areas by its nature. Therefore, look around the 3 places that I had mentioned, and especially the watersides, lakes... are the places you need to pay good attention to. Take this amulet just in case. The *singing flowers* all possess small amounts of poison... This will help you.
