!Wind Sylph:

Nice to meet you, wise man of the magic world who manages the elements. I am the *Wind Sylph*, messenger of Zephyr, guide of the storms. Did you come to me to get the *Tone of Wind*, by any chance?

The wind is an inessential figure, which nobody can get hold of... Do you think you can get a note consisting of such wind? Only I can give you the *Tone of Wind* So you must make a deal with me.
