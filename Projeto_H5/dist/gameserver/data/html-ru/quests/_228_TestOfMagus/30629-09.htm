!Bard Rukal:

To make an Absolute Tone we need 4 tones that correspond to 4 elements. As you know, our world is composed of these 4 elements and the 4 tones represent the 
essence of each element.

That is, we can only make the Absolute Tone which controls all other tones by collecting 4 notes that correspond to the 4 elements.

Remember, collecting these 4 tones is a difficult, time-consuming task..
