!Flame Salamander:

What is it, my child? Have you no fear of fire?

...Ah, you seek the *Note of Fire*... I see...

Of course I have it, silly! Nothing comes for free, however...

If you will journey north, near the *Ivory Tower*, and retrieve *5 Flame Crystals* from the *ghost fires*, I shall take them in exchange for the *Note of Fire*! But not one less than 5!
