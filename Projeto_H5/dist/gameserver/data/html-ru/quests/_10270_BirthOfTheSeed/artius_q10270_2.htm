!War Mage Artius:

Ah, Plenos. Lousy coward has scared about the mission I need to complete. What he told you? Kill 3 butterflies? Ha! No! It's dangerous!

Well, I don't know how to say... I need *Yehan Klodekus' Badge, Yehan Klanikus' Badge and Lich Crystal*.

Those are items from the powerful bosses inside Seed of Infinity. I need them for the magic I'm testing. The reward is good, will you agree to get me those?
