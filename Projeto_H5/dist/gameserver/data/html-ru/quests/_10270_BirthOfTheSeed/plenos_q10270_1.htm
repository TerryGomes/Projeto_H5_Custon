!Soldier Plenos:

Welcome to Gracia continent, young adventurer!

It's been quite long time since I was in Seeds, but I have my duty here, on the Alliance base. Maybe you will help me with one important job?

It's not big deal, *War Mage Artius* said it's just a few things to do and reward is good. So what you say, will you take the mission?

[Quest _10270_BirthOfTheSeed take|"Yes, of course."]
