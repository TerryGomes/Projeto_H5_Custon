!Flame Salamander:

Ah ... I see you have found the key. I give you the flame earring as a token of fire. I name you predecessor of the flame ... Pray, do not neglect the desire for learning now rising within you.

Your desires for knowledge lead to curiosity about the world. Thought caught up in that curiosity cannot stay in one place for very long, and will wander continuously in search of new knowledge. This is why the strong curiosity that stirs the scholar to travel is often compared to the wind.

The next thing you must find is the *token of wind*. *In order to find it, you must first speak to the Wind Sylph. She is staying at the entrance of the Wastelands beyond the southwestern mountains. As you already know, there are three entrances to the Wastelands. The sylph will be at the northwest entrance.* I wish you luck!
