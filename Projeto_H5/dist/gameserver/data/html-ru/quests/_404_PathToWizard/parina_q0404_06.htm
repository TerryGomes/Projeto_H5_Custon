I see you have collected all four tokens of water, fire, wind and earth. Through the journey to collect tokens, you have proven your passion for learning, curiosity about the world, powers of deep investigation and contemplation, and strong will. You have created your future with your own hands.

I give you the *bead of four seasons* Take this bead to the high priest. I'm sure he can guide you to the path of the Wizard. May your future days always be filled with light.
