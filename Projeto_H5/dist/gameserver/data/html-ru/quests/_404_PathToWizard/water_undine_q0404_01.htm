!Water Undine:

Don't be a nuisance and disappear. I am busy purifying the force of water in the surrounding land!

You want to earn the token of water? Well then, do me one favor. Do you see that lake? On the other side of the lake is a monster shaped like a strange eye called the *water seer*. It disturbs the force of water in this area and really gives me a headache.

*Kill the water seer and bring back two sparkle pebbles as proof. Then I will give you the token of water.*
