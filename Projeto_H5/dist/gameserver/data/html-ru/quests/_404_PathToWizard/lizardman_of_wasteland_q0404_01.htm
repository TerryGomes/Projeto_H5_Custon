!Lizardman of the Wastelands:

Nice to meet you, Human. I am a minstrel who savors the music in nature and loves to sing loudly. I regret that I cannot chat with you long. I am in the middle of listening to the song brought to me by the winds of the Wastelands.

You've come because you have some business with me? What business are you talking about?
