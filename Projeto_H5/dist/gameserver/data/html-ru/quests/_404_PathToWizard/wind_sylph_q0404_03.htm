!Wind Sylph:

Thank you very much. Now I can meditate in peace. I was thinking of going to some other land because it was so noisy. As a token of my appreciation, I give you the token of wind. 

Searcher of the wind, please do not forget your naive curiosity about materials.

Curiosity always leads to investigation. The deep contemplation and research of a magician is very often compared to the deep waters of a lake.

Now you must find the *token of water*. *In order to find it, you must meet the undine of the water. She is near Permel Lake.* The lake can be found if you pass the abandoned camp of the ol mahums in the north and continue a little farther north. Well then, may the divine protection of wind be with you.
