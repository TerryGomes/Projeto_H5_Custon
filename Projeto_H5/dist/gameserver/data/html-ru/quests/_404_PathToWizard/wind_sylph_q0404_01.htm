!Wind Sylph:

I see you have come to find the Wind Token. The winds blowing here told me of your story. If you grant me one favor, I will happily give you the Wind Token.

Not long ago, *the wastelands Lizardman* appeared in the Southern Wastelands, and it has been so noisy ever since that I haven't been able to savor the wind comfortably.

Please make the wastelands Lizardman quiet so my meditations are not disrupted. Then I will give you the Wind Token.

Since scary monsters are prowling around on the southern hills, it would be safer for you to follow the western path of the valley and then head south.
