!Flame Salamander:

What is it, child of Humans? Aren't you frightened by the fumes of fire that I breathe? It has been a long time since I've seen a Human as fearless as you. So you've come to find the token of flame? Now I see that you are a Mystic who controls the powers of elements! Good ... If you grant me a favor, I will give you the token of flame.

The key of flame that I had in my charge was stolen not long ago. The rascal that took the key was a *Ratman Warrior*. He is in fact an evil spirit in disguise, that covets the power of fire. How else could he have tricked me and stolen the key? Please find the scoundrel and recover the key. There are many Ratman Warriors north of these ruins or west beyond the mountains.
