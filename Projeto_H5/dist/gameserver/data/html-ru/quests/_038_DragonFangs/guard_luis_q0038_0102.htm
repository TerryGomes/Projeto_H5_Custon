!Guard Luis:

Your face is unfamiliar. You must be traveling through here.

I trust you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory. It was enough to have ol mahum stragglers and Turek Orcs bothering us, now the lizardmen have joined in!

The *highway of the southern shoreline* that leads to Giran has seen frequent attacks by *Langk Lizardman*. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked! We need more experienced help.

(Only a character of level 19 or above may undertake this quest.)
