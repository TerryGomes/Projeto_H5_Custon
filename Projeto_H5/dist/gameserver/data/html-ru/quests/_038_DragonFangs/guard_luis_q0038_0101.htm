!Guard Luis:

I`ve been looking for someone like you.

I trast you've seen the havoc wrought throughout Gludio Territory. It was enough to have Ol Mahum Stragglers and Turek Orcs bthering us. Now the Lizardmenfrom the south!

The *highway of the southern shoreline* that leads to Giran has seen frequent  attacs by *Langk Lizardmen*. People are scared. Even the temple priests traveling to Gludin were attacked!  We Gludio guards traveling to Gludin were attacked! We Gludio guards
are already stretched thin.

Will you help us?
