!Magister Iris:

You're back! I've been waiting for you! We must hurry!

Word has come from the guards that Langk lizardmen are attacking travelers again! They must be dealt with immediately! Please give me Magister Rohmer's reply!

Just as I thought! We can do this, we just need to gather the ingredients we need to nullify their sorcery. We'll have this problem resolved soon! Will you help me finish the job?
