!Magister Iris:

What can I do for you? Ah, Luis sent you! What's this about?

Oh I see! Those vile Langk lizardmen are causing problems in the south. You've already dealt with them? Very impressive!

The Langk lizardmen's sorcery has long been a mystery to us. Up to now we haven't given them much thought, since our magic has been more than enough to keep them in check. This new sorcery of theirs is something else, however. I must find out what they're up to. I'm glad to see you! Well, let me take a look at that...

Hmm... This is no ordinary object! What could be the source of its mysterious power?... Who would have such a thing?... I can't say where it came from, but it's obvious that its sorcery bestows the power of a formidable entity into the bodies of Warriors... and I detect the scent of a dragon! I fear the Land Dragon has awakened from its slumber...

Well, we've obviously got to deal with this thing. Hopefully it's not too late... But what ever shall we do? Its power is growing by the moment!... I'll bet Magister Rohmer of Gludio Castle knows what we should do.... But I can't just drop everything and run to him...
