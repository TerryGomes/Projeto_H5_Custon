!Guard Luis: 

Thanks to your help, the southern shoreline road is much Safer!

Let me see the Feather Ornaments.

Hmm... this one's odd. This is a very ominous tooth, not a normal Langk Lizardman decoration. There's something sinister here.

Can you take this tooth to *Magister Iris* of Einhazad Temple?
