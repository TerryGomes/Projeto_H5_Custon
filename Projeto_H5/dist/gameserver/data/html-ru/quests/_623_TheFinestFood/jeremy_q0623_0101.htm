!Chef Jeremy:

Long ago, the most distinguished aristocrats of the empire came here for their excursions. Those bastards! When I refused to be their personal chef, they insulted my food! They have no appreciation for haute cuisine!

As hard as they tried, no one could find fault with my food!

Those cretins had the nerve to point out that they weren't served a specialty dish indigenous to this region!

Then and there I resolved to make a dish so indigenous to this region that those barbarians would be silenced once and for all!

But, as I'm sure you're aware, it takes more than ingredients to make a dish.

The monsters in this region are too tough, don't you think?

Will you help me?
