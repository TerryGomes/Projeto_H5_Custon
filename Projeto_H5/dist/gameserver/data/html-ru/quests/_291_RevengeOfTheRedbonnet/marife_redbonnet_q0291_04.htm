... *Forty wolf pelts*! Is that too difficult a task? How come you didn't keep your promise? Somewhere right now, a young girl is being eaten by a wolf! I can see that!

Run out of the village now and kill all the black wolves! I want to smell the blood of wolves! The bloody stench of my enemies! All the wolves in the world must be killed!
