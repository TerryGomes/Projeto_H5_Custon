!Maryse Redbonnet:

When I was 10, I decided to kill all the wolves in the world, because they killed my loving family. I didn't want this to happen to others, you see. That's why I became a wolf hunter... I still vividly remember my first kill... It was a wolf cub that was only a few days old. I killed it without mercy.

After that, I killed every wolf that I saw! I killed hundreds, I mean, thousands of wolves! People saw me carrying a bundle of wolf pelts and called me the *Redbonnet the horrible*.

But now I am too old to hunt wolves. So, someone should kill the wolves in my stead! I want to smell their blood... The bloody stench of the enemies who killed my family! Please... It is my wish... Please kill the wolves! Kill them all!
