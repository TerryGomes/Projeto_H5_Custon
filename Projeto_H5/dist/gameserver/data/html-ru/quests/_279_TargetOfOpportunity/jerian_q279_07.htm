!Jerian:

Wait a moment, please...

<font color="LEVEL">(As Jerian chants a spell you've never heard, the four fragments begin to float in the air rotating around one another until coming together in a bright flash. When the light fades, you see a red and blue stone floating back into Jerian's hands. It is a complete Seal Breaker.)</font>

Here, it is complete. Remember though, you can only use it once. When you pass through the Force Field, it will shatter.

Good bye and good luck.
