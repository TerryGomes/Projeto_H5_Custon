!Warehouse Chief Natools:

They argue that we should respect diversity...

They claim that all powers and creatures are equal, and that the Temple and the Rulers of Dawn are simply trying to accumulate power and wealth for their own benefit.
The Preachers and the Revolutionaries of Dusk say that their opponents are hypocrites and liars intent on using religion to exploit the people...
They believe that true peace can only be achieved by respecting diversity of race, culture and belief. The use of force, they say, will only create a tyrannical artificial peace.
As the evidence of the hypocrisy of the Temple, they claim that Einhasad did not actually create Humans -- that story was concocted solely by Emperor Schuneimann in order to consolidate his power. The Temple and the Rulers of Dawn have perpetuated that myth, they say, to maintain their hold on power.<br>Both the Preachers and the Revolutionaries of Dusk are intent on finding iron-clad evidence of the Temple's hypocrisy that will sway the people to their side.
