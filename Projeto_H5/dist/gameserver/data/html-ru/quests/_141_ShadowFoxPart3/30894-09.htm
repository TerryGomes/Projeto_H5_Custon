!Warehouse Chief Natools:

I had originally planned to give you several more missions to prove yourself worthy of being a high-level agent.
But the situation has changed, and I now need your assistance with a particularly sensitive and important mission.
On the basis of my personal authority, I hereby confer on you the title of high-level agent.
