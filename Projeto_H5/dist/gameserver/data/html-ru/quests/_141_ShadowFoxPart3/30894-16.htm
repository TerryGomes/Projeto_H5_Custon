!Warehouse Chief Natools:

Very well. The Temple and the Rulers of Dawn believe that Einhasad created Humans, and that they are her rightful representatives in this world, with the power to issue commands in her name.
They believe that the other gods are inferior to Einhasad, and so their followers should submit to the Temple's leadership in the war against Shilen and the forces of chaos.
Unity and order are their chief concerns, and they take a dim view of diversity and individualism.
In fact, they believe that only through a unified society built on a rigid hierarchy can justice prevail and the weak be truly protected.
Certainly, their argument carries some weight: the weak are daily attacked and exploited, and justice seems but a dream to most...
Ultimately, the Temple and the Rulers of Dawn hope for some sort of reborn empire to bring peace and order to the land...
