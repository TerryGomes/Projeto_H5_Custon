Thanks for helping us! Basically, we need two things done.

First and most important, *wipe out the dark magi*! They are our biggest threat! Defeat them and you'll be well-rewarded! Please slay at least 200 of them!

Also, I would ask that you please *exterminate the undead that are wandering around here during the day*. We've been plagued by those filthy wretches for far too long! When you destroy them, you'll find their rotting livers remain. I'll reward you for each one you bring to me!

Bring as many as you want, any time that you want! But remember, I ask that you kill at least 200 black magi before you return to me. Got it?
