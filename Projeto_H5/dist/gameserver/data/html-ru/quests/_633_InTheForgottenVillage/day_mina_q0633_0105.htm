Oh, you're back! And you have brought proof of killing 200 Black Mages, yes?

Very good, very good indeed! As I promised, you'll be well rewarded for your troubles. But, ah... well, as you can plainly see, our little village simply doesn't have the resources to cover your expenses on our own -- perhaps it slipped my mind to mention it, but it's actually the responsibility of *our lord* to give out rewards for hunting the undead...
