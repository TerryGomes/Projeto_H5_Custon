!Mina:

Surely you've seen the undead lurking about the village? They've been around as long as anyone around here can remember! Recently, we've been plagued by dark magi, and as you can imagine, it's been very chaotic!

Things are so topsy-turvy, I doubt that the trees will even bear fruit this season!

We need a strong, helping hand! Would you help our village?
