!High Summoner Galatea:

Oh, thank you! My investigation is finally going somewhere! It seems to me that there's a connection between the devastation in southern Gludio and the Sylphs... you know, those insane Wind Spirits in *Windy Hill*...

Unfortunately, that's as far as I've gotten with my research. Could you bring me Fairy Breath from those pesky vermin in Windy Hill? Hunt the *Sobbing Wind, Babbling Wind and Giggling Wind* and then find what is known as the *Container of Fairy Breath* and bring those to me. The breath of a Sylph is quite an odd thing I know... but you'll know what I'm talking about when you get there...
