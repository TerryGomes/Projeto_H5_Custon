!High Summoner Galatea:

Long ago, Gludio was consumed in the Burning War when the forces of the Ivory Tower confronted the bastard demon Beleth. Beleth's evil permanently scarred the land, leaving nothing but desolation and waste.

I've been researching ways to restore Gludio to its former beauty. Will you come back and help me when you've increased in your abilities?
