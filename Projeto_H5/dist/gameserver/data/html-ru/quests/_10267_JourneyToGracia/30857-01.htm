<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Do you know the tragedy that has befallen <font color="LEVEL">Gracia</font>? The power of Shilen, the Goddess of Death, has manifested itself in the form of a <font color="LEVEL">Seed</font> that has transformed the entire continent into a land of death. Despite the valiant efforts by a few lords and their warriors, most of Gracia is chaos and evil.<br>Do you know what this means? When <font color="LEVEL">Gracia has fallen completely into evil, Aden will be targeted next</font>. Our leaders met in what is being called the <font color="LEVEL">Giran Assembly</font> and decided we must face this threat as a unified group. The Kamael were finally welcomed into the alliance at that time.<br>
Now we need brave adventurers to fight this rising tide of darkness. Please help!<br>
