!Dead Leopard's Carcass:

<center>
[A ghost is much like a fire:

approach it with great care,

a proper distance bear,

and grow as warm as you desire.

But stray too close to the source,

And it will eat you whole;

For ghosts and fiery coals,

Have no means to restrain their force.

Remember the teachings of Pa'agrio!

Remember the Song of Fire!

*In order to hear the last teaching,*

*Drench your hands once more with the blood of the Black Leopard!]*
