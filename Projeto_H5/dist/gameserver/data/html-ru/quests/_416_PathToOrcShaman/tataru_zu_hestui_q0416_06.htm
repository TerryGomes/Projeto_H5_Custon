!Tataru Zu Hestui:

The language of flame cannot be taught, only learned. Confused? Ha!

If you wish to learn the language of flame, my young friend, you must summon the Hestui Totem Spirit.
 The spirit, who takes the form of a Kasha Bear, symbolizes dignity and wisdom.

Before attempting the summoning, however, you must first bring me a *Kasha Bear Pelt and Kasha Bladespider Husk*.
 You must also hunt the *Scarlet Salamander* and obtain one of its *Fiery Eggs*.
