!Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:

 ... If you want, I will teach you ... But I must ask a favor in return ...

... One of the evil spirits I sealed in my web of space and time has escaped ... I have come all the way here to Gludio to catch that scoundrel ... Impertinently, it is hiding in the body of my offspring ...!

*Poison spiders, bind poison spiders*, all my adorable children ... The *durka spirit*that I seek is hidden in my children's bodies.

 ... You must hunt spiders and make it reveal itself ... Take this spider web of space and time that I have spun. When you have pinned the durka spirit down, seal it in this net and bring it to me. Then I will teach you what you wish to learn.
