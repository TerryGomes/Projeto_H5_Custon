!Seer Moira:

Congratulations, young Orc, on taking the first step in this world!

I want you to learn here in Schuttgart how to inherit the wisdom of the souls!

Behold this Black Leopard in front of me! He's the Gandi Totem Spirit, the wisest of all Totem Spirits!

Talk to him and receive his knowledge! He'll help you!
