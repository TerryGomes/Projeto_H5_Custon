!Duda-Mara Totem Spirit:

Oh-ho! To meet the offspring of Paagrio in such a remote land! What do I call you?

Wait, are you a Shaman that can speak the language of spirits? You must have come to steal the secret of spirits away from me? Go away! If you do not want to be tied up tight in my web and hung for all eternity, begone!
