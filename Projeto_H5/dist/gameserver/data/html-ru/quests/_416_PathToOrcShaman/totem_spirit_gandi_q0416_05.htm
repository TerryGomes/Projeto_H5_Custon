!Totem Spirit of Gandi:

Ha!

Well, there's no need for you to feel pain, young Orc.

From the time that Pa'agrio created you, you were supposed to be like this!

The shape of burning fire is not one and the kind of fire is not one either.

You've been cleansed with the blood of Gandi's family, now other Totem Spirits cannot ignore you... krrrr...

Now, speak with Seer Moira over there. Since you have my wisdom, he'll lead you to a Shaman.
