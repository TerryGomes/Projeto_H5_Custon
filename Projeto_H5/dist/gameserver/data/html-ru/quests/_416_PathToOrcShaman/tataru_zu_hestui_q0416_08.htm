!Tataru Zu Hestui:

Now I will make you a totem mask from the Kasha Bear Pelt and Kasha Bladespider Husk you brought.
 It will enable you to learn the language of flame when you meet our Hestui Totem Spirit.

The Fiery Egg you obtained from the Scarlet Salamander contains an unborn spirit whose existence is not yet ordained.
 It is truly a valuable item, fit to offer to the Totem Spirit as a gift.

Now go to the Ruins south of the Temple of Pa'agrio and seek the *Hestui Totem Spirit*.
 Dejakyar Lamme! May the eternal flame guide your path.
