!Master Ellenia:

The eradication of the plague bringers has begun! Please hurry to the abandoned *Underground Elven Fortress*. Do you remember the contract you signed with me? Destroy the dirty *ratmen* and bring back their *fangs* as proof, and I will reward you for each item of proof you bring me. I will give you an exceptionally large reward if you kill their leader, *Varool Foulclaw*, and bring me one of his fangs.
