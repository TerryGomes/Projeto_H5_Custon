!Watcher of Valakas Klein:

Meet *Blacksmith Hilda in Goddard Castle Town and bring me Vacualite*. If a magic power is infused in it, it can activate the magic. It's a very unique mineral, and can only be used once.

With it I can create a disposable *Floating Stone* to get through the Hall of Flames.
