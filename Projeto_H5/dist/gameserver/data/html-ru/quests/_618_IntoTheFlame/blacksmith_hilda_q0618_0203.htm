!Blacksmith Hilda:

You haven't brought enough! As I said, open the bellies of the *Kookaburra, Bandersnatch and Grendel* in the Garden of Wild Beasts. Sometimes their entrails contain *Vacualite ore*. This is probably due to their strange diet... Bring me *50 pieces* of Vacualite ore and I'll make you a Vacualite.
