!Trader Nika:

Ah, Marcela sent you.
 Demand for goods has increased lately because of the opening of the island, and we have been sent scrambling to find enough supplies.
 In fact, we have even had to trade with the other races - the capacity of the Dwarves to mobilize capital and material is particularly incredible.
 One day I'd like to open a store on the mainland to really increase our profit margin.
 The scale of business out there is completely different than it is here...

Anyway, I think we have secured sufficient supplies for now.

Here, give this manifest to Marcela.
