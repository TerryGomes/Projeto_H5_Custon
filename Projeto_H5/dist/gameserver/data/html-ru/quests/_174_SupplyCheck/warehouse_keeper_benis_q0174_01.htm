!Warehouse Keeper Benis:

Ah, you are helping Marcela with this work...

Here...

This is the season's list of the supplies I have received and placed in inventory.
 After the island was opened to outsiders, I worried because we received many demands for goods, and we were a little short on even basic supplies.
 Hurry and deliver this *Warehouse Manifest* to *Marcela*.
