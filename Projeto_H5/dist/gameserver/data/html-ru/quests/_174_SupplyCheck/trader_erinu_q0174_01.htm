The quality of a weapon, whether dagger or great sword, directly affects the confidence of the wielder, you know. How would you feel about facing a horde of Orcs with just a rusty, dull old broadsword?
 Not good, I wager! But with a superbly balanced, razor-sharp, perfectly-matched blade...well, it'd be a different story.

Well, well! Pay no heed to my musings. A man like me notices a thing or two over the years.

Do have any business with me? If not, you should focus your energies on training!
