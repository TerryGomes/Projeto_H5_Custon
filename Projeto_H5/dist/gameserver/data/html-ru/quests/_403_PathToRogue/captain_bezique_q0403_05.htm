!Captain Bezique:

Aren't you an ambitious young one. Very well! I will explain what you must do.

Recently, a *pack of thieves* has been running wild near Gludin Village and causing us problems. They know that our village is in disorder because of the restoration project, and they have been exploiting the opportunity to sneak in and out, stealing the property of many innocent people.

According to the people who have seen them, they are not humans but Ol Mahums. They are so fast that our guards lose them in pursuit every time. If you can capture those thieves, we will recognize your talents and recommend you to be a Rogue.
