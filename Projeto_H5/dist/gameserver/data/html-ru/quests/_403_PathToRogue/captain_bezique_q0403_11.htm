!Captain Bezique:

Why are you still here? Hurry along -- kill the Cat's Eye bandits and recover the four stolen items. Remember that you must use the bow and dagger that Neti gave you to kill those scoundrels.

According to my men, the thieves are near the abandoned campgrounds. If you don't know how to get there, ask Guard Praga.
