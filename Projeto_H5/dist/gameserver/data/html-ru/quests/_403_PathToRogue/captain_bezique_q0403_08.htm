!Captain Bezique:

I understand that you have received a "Horseshoe of Light" from Neti. You must be more talented than you look, but if Neti gave you this, she has faith in your abilities. So let's start going after those thieves in earnest. This is the *Most Wanted List.*

I'm sure you can tell from reading the list, but your opponents are called the *Cat's Eye Bandits.* They're named for their leader, nicknamed Cat's Eye for whatever reason, and are all of the Ol Mahum race. According to my scouts, their base is located near the *Abandoned Camp* where the runaway Ol Mahum troops pitch camp. If you don't know how to get there, go and ask Guard Praga.

*Use the bow and dagger that Neti gave you to capture the Cat's Eye gang in one stroke. And bring back the 4 types of items that were stolen from the people of this village.* Should be a good test of your mettle. Good luck!
