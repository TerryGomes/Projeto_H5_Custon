!Maid Leikar:

Oh, you're wonderful! You brought all the items I requested! That was quite a journey you made! Please give me the materials. You can take a rest under the tree over there! We don't have much time left, so I'll get started right away.

By the way, do you happen to have the dress shoes with you?
