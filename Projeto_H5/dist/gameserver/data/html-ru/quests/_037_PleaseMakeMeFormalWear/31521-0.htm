!Chef Jeremy:

What brings you here? Can't you see how busy I am?

You're here for the cookies?

Let me see the stamp of the person who ordered it. Ah, you're here for Leikar! You're early! They're not ready yet.

Don't rush me. I've got and idea, why don't you help me? They'll be ready much quicker...
