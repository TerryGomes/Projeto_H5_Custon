!Maid Leikar:

Hello! What can I do for you?

Formal wear? I'm sorry, but I need to run an errand now. I'll be gone for quite a while...

Don't make that face! Hmm... I have an idea! Will you help me?

I need to run an errand that will take a while. If you do it for me, I'll start the preparations for your formal wear.
