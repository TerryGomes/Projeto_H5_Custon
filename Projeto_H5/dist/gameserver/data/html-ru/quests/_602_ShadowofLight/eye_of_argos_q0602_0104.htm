!Eye of Argos:

Your courage may yet save the world!

Daimon the White-Eyed uses his underlings to transform monsters into slaves. Once they've been transformed, they're beyond redemption. Kill them so they can rest in peace.

You can get the eyes of darkness if you kill Buffalo Slaves and Grendel Slaves. When you get 100 eyes of darkness, visit me again.
