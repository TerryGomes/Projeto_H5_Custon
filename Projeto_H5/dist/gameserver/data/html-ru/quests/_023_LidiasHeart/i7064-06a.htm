!Lidia's Diary:

The thirtieth day of the month of Shilen.

Tomorrow's the big day!%%
I wasn't able to talk Father out of it.%%
Nidrah's words just made too much sense!

The royal authority of Rune has been tenuous for ages, and something must be done!%%
Brother Eilhalder said that our family's primary role is to protect Rune itself, not the royal family!

I'm not sure I believe all that...

Nidrah came to me this evening.%%
He told me that no matter what I decided, I must always show courage in terrible times.%%
What did he mean by that?%%
I've always been courageous!
