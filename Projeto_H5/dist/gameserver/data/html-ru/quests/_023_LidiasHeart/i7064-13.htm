!Lidia's Diary:

[A different handwriting]

I don't understand!%%
Obviously I did it, but without knowing!%%
I look in the mirror and her face looks back at me, but there is no mirror!%%
Only an image.%%
I don't understand any of this!%%
Where are my memories?%%
They seem to be there, but unaccessible!%%
He must have done something to me!

Everything that happens is recorded but forgotten!%%
Both regret and satisfaction are the result.%%
The Moon Face Flower on your hairpin will seal this Contract.
