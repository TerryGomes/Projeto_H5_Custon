!Lidia's Diary:

The Darkness of Abyss

The starlight is reflected in his smile.

He speaks of courage, but I don't know where or even who I am!

Can a crazy person have courage?%%
Who knows?

His laughter rings out, and again the word, courage.%%
The are other words, but they're in an otherworldly language I don't understand.

The Dark Mage with his dark smile speaks softly to me, holding my hand in the dark night.

Courage.%%
Courage.%%
Courage.%%
Nothing else matters.

My ceremony is still going on!%%
What brings you here so late?
