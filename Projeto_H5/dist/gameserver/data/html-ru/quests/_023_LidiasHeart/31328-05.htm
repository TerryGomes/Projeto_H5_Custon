According to a custom from the Elmoreden period, a Silver Spear was the symbol of the family responsible for guarding the royal family.%%

An ancient proverb says, *"A jeweled scepter for the mighty King of Elmore and two Silver Spears for his protectors"*.%%

I'll wager that somewhere is a lock that matches this key...
