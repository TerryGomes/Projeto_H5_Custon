!Lidia's Diary:

The twenty-fourth day of Shilen.

Rose delivered my invitation to Nidrah, and he accepted too easily!

I was so rushed when I made the preparations!%%
I must've made a thousand mistakes, but he never complained once!%%
Was he just being nice?%%
Or maybe he didn't care!

He told me that he was here on business; business having nothing to do with our family.

What is he up to?
