!Grand Magister Fairen:

Did you meet Noctisse? Did she tell you that I was trying to kill her? Ha! Sure she did!%%
Listen to me carefully! Noctisse is very ambitious! She stops at nothing in her quest for power! In fact, she even stole the documents about the pilgrimage of tablets from me! She's ruthless, I tell you!%%
You must be careful of her! I'm sure she'll try to use you to discover the secrets of the tablets... Mind my words!
