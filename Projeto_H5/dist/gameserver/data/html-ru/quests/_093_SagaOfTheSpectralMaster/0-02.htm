!Grand Magister Fairen:

Well, shall I check your records? Let's see, you were educated at the Temple of Shilen, obtained a certificate of Dark Wizard from the Altar of Rites in the Dark Forest, passed the Test of the Summoner with flying colors, and even obtained a Recommendation from Galatea!%%
Your records are awesome! Unfortunately, it's come to our attention that your research activities have slowed down since you were promoted to Phantom Summoner. Work harder! Eventually, I'll recommend that you become a candidate for* Spectral Master*, the ultimate summoner! Do your best!

(Only characters of level 76 or above and of the Phantom Summoner class may undertake this quest.)
