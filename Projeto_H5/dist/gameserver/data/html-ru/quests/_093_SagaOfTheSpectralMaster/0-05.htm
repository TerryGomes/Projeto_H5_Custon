!Grand Magister Fairen:

No book or scroll speaks of the ultimate summoning spell. It's secrets have always been in the domain of the gods, far from the grasp of mere Humans. The secret is supposedly written only on six ancient tablets, hidden by the gods in secluded areas and protected by formidable beasts!%%
Once you've overcome all the difficulties that the gods could imagine, and learned the knowledge contained in the six tablets, you'll become a Spectral Master.%%
Someone has already left on the pilgrimage before you.* Summoner Noctisse* is a young woman who's advancing rather quickly, like a bright new star, shining in the dawn sky. I'm sure she could tell you a few things about the pilgrimage of tablets if you approached her right. She has has a somewhat notorious personality!
