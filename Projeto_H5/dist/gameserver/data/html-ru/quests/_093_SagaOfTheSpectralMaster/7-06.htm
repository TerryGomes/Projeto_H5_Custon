!Tablet of Vision:

The Tablet of Vision begins to be wrapped up in brightness. Thunderous chanting clogs your mind and yet gives you understand of something.... something that cannot be understood!

Grand Magister Fairen has the Stone of Commune! The vision disappears slowly, and there is the Tablet of Vision, no longer emitting light.
