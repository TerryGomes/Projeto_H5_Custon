!Chamberlain Frederick:

You must know a territory well in order to rule it well. As I'm sure you are aware, there are a number of pagans in Rune territory. They are an influential group; you would be well advised to win their support. If you do not, your reign will likely be short and uncomfortable. I suggest you go see Agripel, the pagan high priest. A declaration of support for us would be very valuable...
