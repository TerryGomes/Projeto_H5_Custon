!Chamberlain Frederick:

To rule this land, you must know it like the back of your hand. At the moment, however, strange things are happening here. You must discover their true nature. My lord, I would suggest that you investigate the cause. There are rumors of a suspicious Wizard there, but we have very few details...

(You will have to undertake the following quests:  "Hidden Truth" and "Hiding Behind the Truth.")
