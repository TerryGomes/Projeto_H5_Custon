!Chamberlain Frederick:

My lord, might I suggest that you open negotiations with Agripel again? If he fails to respond, wait a while. I suspect he will change his tune when he gets word of what has happened! Then you should have a strong hand with which to negotiate. But do not let him think you planned this, my lord!
