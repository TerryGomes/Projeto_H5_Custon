!Warehouse Chief Natools:

I do not know the angel's location, but we have been requested to search for something called the *Sealed Prophecy: Path of the God*.

Your predecessor has already secured it...

They think it contains clues to the whereabouts of the angel.

Apparently, once the angel is located, its message can be recorded using a unique Echo Crystal...

Now, go to *Grand Master Tobias in the town of Gludio* and ask him about the matter...

Here, take the Sealed Prophecy: Path of the God with you...
