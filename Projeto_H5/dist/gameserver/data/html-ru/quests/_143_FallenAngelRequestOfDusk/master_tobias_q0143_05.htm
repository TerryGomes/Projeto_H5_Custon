!Grand Master Tobias:

Both the Preachers of the Wilderness and the Revolutioneries of Dusk heard the sounds of the angel asking for aid...
Apparently he was injurned and being pursued by something very powerful.
Now that u know where he is, the first thing to do is to heal him.
Elder Casian is *somewhere in the wilderness* -- his medicine can heal the angel.
Find him and obtain the medicine.
If you give him the Prophecy, he can tell you the Angel's exact location.
Then u must heal the angel and place his message within this empty Echo Crystal...
Casian will give you the details.
