!Elder Casian:

Yes, the prophecy says that an unknown adventurer will become an important figure in the salvation of the world.
Ah! Here! I found the road to the angel's location. It is a dangerous place, full of monsters...
Shadow Fox trust you, however, so perhaps you can make it through...
If so, adventurer, you will be the first to directly communicate with the angel.
Perhaps it is you to whom the prophecies refer after all...
