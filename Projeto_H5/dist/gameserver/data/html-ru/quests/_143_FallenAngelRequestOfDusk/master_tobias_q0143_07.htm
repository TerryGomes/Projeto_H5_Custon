!Grand Master Tobias:

Ah, I had every confidience that you would succeed! Well done!
However, we still cannot officially denounce the hypocrisy of the Temple of the Rulers of Dawn.
The nobility will never see the proof we lay before them...not yet, at any rate.
But your service to our case will not be forgotten, that I promise you!
