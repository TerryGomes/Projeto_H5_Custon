!Fallen Angel:

In a way, Shilen is also victim...
 Why has Mother not used her great power to restore things to their natural order?
 Why has Gran Kain, that trouble-making lover of chaos, become a father figure to the gods?
 Chaos and order should not be able to co-exist... And why is the goddess of order falsely idolized by the people of chaos...
 I cannot understand this.
 Perhaps that is why I could not become a goddess...
