!Master Minia:

Please gather ten arrowheads used by the Tunath Orc Marksmen and bring them to me. I am not collecting them simply for my private purposes, but plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall for exhibition.

Tunath Orcs are in the Elven Ruins. If you don't know where that is, ask Guard Kenyos for directions.
