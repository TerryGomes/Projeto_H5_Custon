!Master Minia:

There are many Orcs on Talking Island, but the Tunath Orcs are at the *Elven Ruins*. There you will be able to find arrowheads used by the Tunath Orc Marksmen. If you don't know how to find the ruins, ask Guard Kenyos.

These would not be soley for my own private collection. I plan to donate some to Sedrick's Training Hall for exhibition, so please bring back ten arrowheads.
