!Captain Bathis:

I realize you just completed a difficult task, but we still need your help!

We must discover the *connection between Maille Lizardmen and the Araneids*. They've been fighting alongside the lizardmen! This is unheard of!

Return to the *Maille Lizardman Barracks* and investigate this unholy alliance! You should be able to find out more if you kill *Maille Lizardman Scouts and Guards* and the *Giant Araneids*.
