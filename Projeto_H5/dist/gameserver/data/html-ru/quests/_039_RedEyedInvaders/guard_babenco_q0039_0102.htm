!Guard Babenco:

I just received a report that a large army of savage *Maille Lizardmen* is gathering in the western section of Gludio Castle Town. They're not satisfied staying on the plains.

*Captain Bathis* is recruiting militiamen in Gludio, and we need help, but this is too dangerous for beginners.

(Only a character of level 20 or above can undertake this quest.)
