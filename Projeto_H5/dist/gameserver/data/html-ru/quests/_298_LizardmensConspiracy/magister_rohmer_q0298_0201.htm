!Magister Rohmer:

Lizardmen are using sorcery to turn arachnids into servants! To dispell it, I'll need the orbs they are using.

Get *shiny colored orbs* from *Maille Lizardman Warriors, Shamans and Matriarchs*. *Poison spiders and giant spiders* have *shiny red colored orbs*. I need fifty of each. Find them in the *north of the Maille Lizardman stronghold*. I'm counting on you!
