!Guard Praga:

As you may know, the *Maille lizardman stronghold* is in the west part of Gludio Castle Town.

During the war with Grecia, they infiltrated our land through a gap in our security, and our guards have been unable to drive them out since. An interesting report about them has recently surfaced, and Magister Rohmer is investigating the matter.

He's hopeful that this new intelligence will allow us to destroy the lizardman forces soon. He's looking for someone to help him with this mission, and I think that you would be perfect for the job! What do you think? Will you help us?
