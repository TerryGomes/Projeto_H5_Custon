!Tablet of Vision:

As you approach the tablet, you feel a presence. Could it be the soul of the one who discouraged Sedrick and degraded the Fallen Knight Adil, here to prevent anyone from learning the secrets of the tablet?%%
It looks back at you with the eyes of* those you chose not to protect*.%%
Now the tablet is before your eyes! Is it an illusion?%%
The sound of swordplay brings you back to reality.
