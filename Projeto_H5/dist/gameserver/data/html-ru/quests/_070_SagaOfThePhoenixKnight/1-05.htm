!Chef Donath:

First, I'll need an* ice crystal* and a* fat white fish*. The dish's name is deceptive. It's actually a lovely cold dish made of fish. As ice crystals are the* legendary food material, Chef Jeremy can tell you more of the details*.%%
You can either get the fish from a fisherman or catch it yourself!
