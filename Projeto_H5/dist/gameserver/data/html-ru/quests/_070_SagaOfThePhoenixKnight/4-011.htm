Do you remember the oath you took when you first became a knight? To defend honor at all cost? Do you think the actions of Sir Herod, who died a miserable death defending his honor, were right? What did you learn from the testimony of trust?%%
Trust is all we knights have to offer!%%
Trust also means faith. You don't betray what you have faith in, nor those who have faith in you. There's only one more thing...%%
You must discover how to earn trust from people...%%
You probably already know all about this. I shouldn't need to explain it to you...%%
Now, ask your last question to the stone tablet.
