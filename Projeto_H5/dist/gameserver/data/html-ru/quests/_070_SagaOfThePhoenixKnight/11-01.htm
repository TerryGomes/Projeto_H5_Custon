!Master Felix:

You haven't finished yet?%%
I really appreciated you saving my daughter. I'll never forget that you* protected* my family.%%
The fifth Stone of Commune? Ah, yes. I have it, but I can't give this one to you. A Knight gave me this an hour ago and told me to tell the next Knight who visits me how to get another one.
