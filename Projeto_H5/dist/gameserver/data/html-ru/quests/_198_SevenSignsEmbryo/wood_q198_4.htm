!Priest Wood:

You're back!

I must ask you to keep your conversation with Franz between just the two of you. You have been made aware of some of our order's greatest secrets; should they become public knowledge our society would be ruined.

Now, I understand I am to give you this, and bid you farewell while you train, and we research. We will contact you soon, so be ready!
