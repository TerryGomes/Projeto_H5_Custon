!Valley Trader Kitzka:

You are truly a trustworthy person. Most adventurers get greedy about these items, so they take my items during delivery and disappear, or they try to provoke me into fighting them. But you... you have shown me a different side your breed.

As it turns out, Sir Silvershadow entrusted me with items for trustworthy adventurers such as yourself. There are three types; I will give you one.
