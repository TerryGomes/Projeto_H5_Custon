I see you have not completed your deliveries yet. Deliver the goods to the people on my list, and bring back their receipts of delivery.

Take the heavy wooden box to Trader Jackson at the weapons shop in the village, the bolts of cloth to Trader Silvia at the village grocery shop, and the clay pot to Warehouse Keeper Rant.
