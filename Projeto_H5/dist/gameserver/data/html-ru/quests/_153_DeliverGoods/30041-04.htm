Deliver these goods to the village people as indicated on this delivery list. It's not a hard task. Of course, you will be compensated for your trouble, so don't worry.

Deliver that heavy wooden box to *Trader Jackson* at the weapons shop, and the bolts of cloth to *Trader Silvia* at the grocery store. And the clay pot should be delivered to *Warehouse Keeper Rant*. Deliver the goods and collect *receipts of delivery*, then bring those receipts back to me. I thank you in advance.
