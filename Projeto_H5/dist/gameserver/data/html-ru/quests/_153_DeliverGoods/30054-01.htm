!Warehouse Keeper Rant:

Ha ha! The pot I ordered from Giran. I was worried that it might break during shipping... Glad to see that it doesn't have even a scratch.

That's right... I have to give you a receipt, right? Here you go. Rant of the Iron Gate Guild confirms delivery of ordered goods! Have a nice day!
