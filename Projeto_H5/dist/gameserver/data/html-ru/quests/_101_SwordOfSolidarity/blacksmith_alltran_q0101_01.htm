!Blacksmith Altran:

Oh! This is Roien's letter! Thank you!

It was a dwarf like me that forged the Sword of Solidarity that's found in the history books, wasn't it? I wonder how a sword that my ancestor made one thousand years ago looked. If I could find the broken sword blade, I'm sure I could remake the Sword of Solidarity in its original form... I'd appreciate it if you could find that broken sword blade for me. Am I asking for too much?
