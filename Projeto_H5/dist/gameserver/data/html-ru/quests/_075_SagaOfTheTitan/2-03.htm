!Prefect Lakan:

This Bitter Cold Vodka is truly the nectar of the gods!%%
It seems like an eternity since I've tasted it! The burn melts my heart and brings back old memories, even though it lacks the true flame of Paagrio!%%
I'll tell you my story now, my friend.%%
My mistake was failing in my attempt to seize the Tower of Insolence! I haven't been a warrior since! I tried teaching for a while, but I was abandoned by my disciple.%%
And that's not all!
