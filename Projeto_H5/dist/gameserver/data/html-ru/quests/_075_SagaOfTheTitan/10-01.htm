!Tablet of Vision:

You hear a disturbance as you approach the tablet.%%
Sounds of rocks crashing, and the roar of a warrior resisting them!%%
No fear of the most awesome opponent, eager for death in battle!%%
They say Orcs were stronger back in the day and I'm inclined to believe them. But I also know that their fiery blood hasn't changed!%%
Is that actually the tablet? The sound of swordplay is carried on the wind.
