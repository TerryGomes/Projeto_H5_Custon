All you have to do is simply draw their attention and I will take care of the rest. Although now that I think it through, it would be even better if you could, uh, get rid of them.

Do so and bring me the *Red Stones* that they carry. No questions! I told you I would reward you well for your trouble. In fact, if you bring *744 Red Stones*, I'll give you something very special. Understand? Good -- we're agreed!

Remember, all you have to do is to get rid of whoever you find on *the first and second floors* of the tower. Good luck!
