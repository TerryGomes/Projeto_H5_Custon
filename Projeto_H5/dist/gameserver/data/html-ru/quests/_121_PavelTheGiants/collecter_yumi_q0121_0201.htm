Collector Yumi:

We have two problems. The first and most urgent is that we are beset by a mad scientist whose work is causing us great harm. I am not sure if you can prevail against him, and in good conscience I cannot send you against him until I am sure. Please go see* Collector Gutenhagen.* He has been in need of assistance, and he can evaluate your fitness for this task. If he passes you, come see me, and I will tell you a tale of the *old manager* of the Pavel Ruins.
