Head Blacksmith Newyear:

You're full of confidence, I see. Well, that's right and proper; you have the skill to back it up. Just the sort of adventurer I need!

In the heart of the Ruins of Pavel there is a Dwarven barracks. There you will find my associate, *Collector Yumi*. She will give you a job if you tell her I sent you. She's, um, a little eccentric. I'm not sure what she'll make of you, but I think you'll pass muster with her.

So, get going! Quests don't keep forever, you know!
