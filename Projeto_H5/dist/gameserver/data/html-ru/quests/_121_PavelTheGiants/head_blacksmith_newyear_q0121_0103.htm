Head Blacksmith Newyear:

You have the right look, I won't argue that.

Now let's find out if you have the skills. Show me how you hold a weapon...

Hmm... I've been a blacksmith here for almost 100 years. I've seen every manner of warrior.

Your hands are too far apart, your grip is loose, and your stance is all wrong. Basically, you aren't ready.

Return here when you've learned your craft better, adventurer. I think you have the potential.

(Only characters of level 70 or above can take on this quest.)
