!Master Terry:

I hope your investigation is going well? Time is short so you must hurry. Do you remember your task? You must hunt *Ol Mahum Captains*, *Turek Orc Warlords*, *Ant Captain*, and *Turak Bugbear Warriors*... Catch them and collect the bezoars from their bodies.

I am not sure if it is due to the bezoars, but they are behaving very *aggressively*. Please, be careful.
