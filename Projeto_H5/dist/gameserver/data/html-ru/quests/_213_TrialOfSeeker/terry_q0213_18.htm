!Master Terry:

I think you are ready for the next task. Being contaminated by a Dark Bezoar is somewhat worrisome, but according to Marina's research, the contamination is limited to only a few creatures. You must destroy those hosts.

*Marsh Stakato Drones*, *Breka Orc Overlords*, *Ant Warrior Captains*, and *Leto Lizardman Warriors* are the monsters you must hunt. Of course, these creatures all have *aggressive tendencies*. Extract the Dark Bezoars from their bodies.

Do you know where they are??
