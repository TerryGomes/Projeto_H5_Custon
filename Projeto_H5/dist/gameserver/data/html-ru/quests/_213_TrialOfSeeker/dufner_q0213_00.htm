!Master Dufner:

I'm not sure if you are aware of it, but the magical creatures have been acting very strange lately. They seem to be organizing for something. I am sure this is a bad sign.

We must find out what those mutants are up to! While it is important to have young volunteers like yourself in service to the kingdom, this particular task requires someone that is skilled in concealment and scouting. I don't think you are up to the task...

If you know anyone that possesses these skills, please tell me.

(This quest may only be performed by Rogues, Elven Scouts, or Assassins of level 35 or higher.)
