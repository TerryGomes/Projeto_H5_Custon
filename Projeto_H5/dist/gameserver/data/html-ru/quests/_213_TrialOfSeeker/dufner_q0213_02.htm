!Master Dufner:

Our kingdom is being threatened by mutants! I am in need of guild members skilled in concealment and scouting. I think you will be very useful once you gain a bit more experience.

If you successfully complete this task the guild will acknowledge your skills and you will find it easier to change to a higher level occupation. Please come back to me when you have more experience. I will be waiting for you.

(This quest may only be performed by Rogues, Elven Scouts, or Assassins of level 35 or higher.)
