!Master Terry:

What did you say to Viktor? He thinks you are a liar!

Did you forget my real name, by any chance? I shall repeat it once more! My true name is *Altebar Karryos*. I took my current moniker 'Terry' from the second letters in my real name.

Anyway, I shall write you another letter. Go and meet Viktor again.
