!Master Terry:

You must heed my every word. We each have our own tasks to do. While I am away you must investigate the mutations one at a time.

They are *Ol Mahum Captain*, *Turek Orc Warlord*, *Ant Captain*, and *Turak Bugbear Warrior*... That's it. I expect that they each have a bezoar planted in their bodies.

The problem is that these creatures are all very aggressive, even more so than normal.

But I think you can handle it... Do you need any more information?
