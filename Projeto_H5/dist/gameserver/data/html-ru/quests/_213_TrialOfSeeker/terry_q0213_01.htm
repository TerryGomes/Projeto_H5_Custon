!Master Terry:

Ah, a letter from Master Dufner... Yes, I am he who was once called the 'Hawkeye'. But Hawkeye is no more... You can't possibly expect me to revive Hawkeye now... That is too much. ...Only Master Dufner would ask such a favor... It was he who helped me abandon Hawkeye and settle down in this town...
