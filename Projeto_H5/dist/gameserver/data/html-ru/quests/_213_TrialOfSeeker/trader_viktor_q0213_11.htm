Ah, good, so we understand each other. Now that we have come to an understanding I feel closer to you. You seem to understand me.

Anyway, let me fill you in on my project. In Giran there is a monster called the Medusa. Have you seen her already? This Medusa is, in fact...oops, no, this is a secret. I am sorry but this cannot be heard by anyone.

Anyway, my point is that I want you to kill the *Medusa* and bring *10 of its scales*. Then I shall give you the information you seek. Welcome to my project, I will be counting on you.
