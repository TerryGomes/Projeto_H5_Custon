!Master Terry:

Since time is of the essence we must attack them systematically. Now listen carefully!

The Ol Mahum Captain can be found *near the Fortress of Resistance* in the northeast.

Next you must go to Gludio, which is quite a distance away. I guess it is becoming obvious that these mutations happened simultaneously in several places around the world.

You can find the Turek Orc Warlord at the *Orc Barracks* in the northern part of Gludio.

You can find the Ant Captain in the *Wastelands* of Gludio. Try the underground *Ant's Nest*. You should not attempt this one alone...

And last, the most dangerous of them all... Have you ever seen the so-called Turak bugbears wandering about *Gorgon Flower Garden in Giran*? Turak bugbear Warriors are their leaders.

Now then, let's get busy. You start your task and I shall follow you soon thereafter.
