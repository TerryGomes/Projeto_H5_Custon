Good. We sentries will take care of hunting the rest of the imps.

Ah! About those imps ... Keep this information to yourself ... I overheard the Elders talking and ... they say that the imps are resisting the submission spell. I hear the elders are preparing an even stronger spell ...

Perhaps the rumor is true that there is a magic user among the imps.
