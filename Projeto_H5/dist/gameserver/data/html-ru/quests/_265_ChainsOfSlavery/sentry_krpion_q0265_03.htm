!Sentry Kristin:

Good. Go into the forest and strike down any *imp* you meet, collect the *shackles* around their necks, and bring them to me. I will compensate you for every shackle you bring me.

In the name of the goddess, may your hunt meet great success! Soon those arrogant imps will once again call us their masters!
