!Sentry Kristin:

Have you seen *imps* in the forest? Those hideous creatures were once slaves that served our race. However, when we were at war with the Elves of Light, they undid the spells of restraint through some unknown method and escaped aboveground.

When I look at the lowly race that used to serve us parading around aboveground, I feel so ... I cannot contain my hurt pride.

However, recently *Tetrarch Velior* said he is preparing a spell that will make the imps submissive again. But he mentioned that he needs the *shackles* from around their necks in order to complete the spell. Would you go into the woods to slay those rude imps and collect their shackles?
