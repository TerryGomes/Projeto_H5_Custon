!Grocer Helvetia:

I analyzed the blood you gave me. I was able to identify the poison, but I'm afraid that I can't give you the antidote for free. It's very rare, so I have to charge you. You understand, don't you? I'm sure the person you save will be happy to reimburse you. The charge is approximately *3 million Adena*... 
You don't want to pay? No skin off my nose. Just remember that even if you have a letter of recommendation from Daeger, I can't simply give this to you for free.
