!Black Marketeer of Mammon:

Ah! So you saved Mark? Thanks to you, I am still in business. But it isn't safe for him to venture into public anymore, so he won't be able to meet you personally. It's for both your sakes, you understand. Don't worry about the details! In any case, he asked me to give you what you needed. Seems like you have some money. How about this?
