!Defender Nathan:

Spinnerets are the organs within the tarantulas' bodies that store the spider silk. Usually one can spin about fifteen skeins of spider silk from one spinneret, but I can easily spin much more than that! If I'm lucky, I can spin as much as twenty skeins!

Here! All done! Hurry up and take these to Mion!
