I'm in trouble! I'm in big trouble! *Van Holter* of Elmore came to me, Mion, and ordered twenty dresses. Formal outfits for the mission to Aden, I heard. Oh dear. What should I do? Not enough time ... not enough materials! The honor of the Silver Scale Guild depends on my two hands now! Oh no ... I have to make the best formal wear! I'm in trouble! Big trouble! I don't know what to do now? *I don't know! I really don't!*

*Tarantula spider silk* is lighter and has better colors than the highest-quality silk! Where can I find enough tarantula spider silk for twenty dresses? That's too much! Who will believe me if I say I couldn't make spider silk dresses made of tarantula spider silk because I couldn't find enough spider silk -- I'm frustrated! I'm frustrated! Tears form in my eyes and the world collapses upon me! Yikes! *I really don't know what to do now ...!*

I do not have much time to make twenty by next week. Eeek! I, Mion, am responsible for this, if I do not finish on time! My fingers are starting to ache, thinking of all those clothes to make ... I will need a pile of laces and ribbons! Who is going to get the spider silk for me? Oh no! I need more materials!!! What should I do? Oh no ... my life is tragic ... now really ...*I don't know what to do!!!*
