!Trader Mion:

Aghhh! What are you doing here? Hey ... I don't have time ... Just spin the silk out of them. If I don't have twenty dresses by next week, I will be kicked out of the Silver Scale Guild!

I am telling you once more. You may receive spider silks only by hunting *crimson tarantulas*, *hunter tarantulas* or *plunder tarantulas*. Just find them quickly and I will pay you back for sure. Also, you may only spin silks by giving *Defender Nathan* the* tarantula spinnerets*! You don't have much time! You should be busy hunting spiders now ... you shouldn't waste your time like this! Please hurry, hurry ... I'm about to cry ...*I don't know what to do now!*
