!Trader Mion:

I'm in trouble! I'm in big trouble! *Van Holter* of Elmore came to me, Mion, and ordered twenty dresses ... Formal outfits for the mission to Aden, I heard. Oh dear. What should I do? Not enough time ... not enough materials! The honor of the Silver Scale Guild depends on my two hands now! Oh no ... I have to make the best formal wear! I'm in trouble! Big trouble! I don't know what to do now? *I don't know! I really don't!*

*Tarantula spider silk* is lighter and has better colors than the highest-quality silk! Where can I find enough tarantula spider silk for twenty dresses? That's too much! Who would believe me if I say I couldn't make spider silk dresses made of tarantula spider silk because I couldn't find enough spider silk ...! Tears form in my eyes and the world collapses upon me! Yikes! *I really don't know what to do now ...!*
