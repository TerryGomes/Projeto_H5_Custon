!Eye of Argos:

Even after my friends, the giants, perished, and the gods tore my body asunder and imprisoned me here, I stayed quiet.

Now, to add insult to injury, they've posted their disciples as guards to watch over me, to humiliate what's left of me! I can't stand it any more!

I'm not as evil as you the children of the world think.

On the contrary, I love peace!

I beseech you! If I attack the guards I'll be severely tortured!

Would you and your soldiers help me?
