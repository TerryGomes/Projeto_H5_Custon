!Sir Klaus Vasper:

You have successfully endured a most demanding trial. Congratulations! Now you are qualified to become a Human Knight.

I will give you the sword of ritual. This sword was used in the knighting ceremony of the legendary Sir Cedric -- bear it with care. If you take this to the Grand Master of the fighters guild, he will change your profession to a Human Knight.

Now, it is time for you to leave. Keep the faith and the romance of chivalry in your heart, and make your own destiny. May the good will of Einhasad always remain with you through every challenge.
