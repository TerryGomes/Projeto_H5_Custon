!Sir Karrel Vasper:

Traditionally, the lord of the citizens who received the apprentice knight's help would show gratitude by inviting the apprentice to his castle and throwing a feast. But these days, the tradition is to give a *Coin of Lords.* A Coin of Lords is a gold coin engraved with a wise saying, showing the lord's gratitude. The right to give out these coins is given to the village guard captain or high priest.

When the pilgrimage is over and the apprentice knight returns, the number of Coins he has determines whether the apprentice knight will be formally recognized as a full-fledged knight.

If you wish to join the Knight Guild and earn the title of a knight, you must also go through this trial. So, my brother of the sword, will you formally go through the trial of the apprentice knight?
