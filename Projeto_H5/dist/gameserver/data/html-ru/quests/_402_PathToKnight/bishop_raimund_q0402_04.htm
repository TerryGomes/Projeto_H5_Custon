!High Priest Raymond:

Even now, I can hear the cries and groans of despair from my priest brothers who cannot find rest. Please bring me *twelve Silver Crosses of Einhasad* from the Undead Priests at the Ruins of Despair, which is to the south of the village, so that I may offer a service to appease their souls.

May Einhasad's blessing be with you.
