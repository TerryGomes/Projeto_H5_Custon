!High Priest Raymond:

Esquire, I beg you! Please go to the *Ruins of Despair* to the south of the village and find the *departed spirits of the priests* that have turned into the undead. Destroy them with your sword and recover the Einhasad crosses that are somewhere on their bodies. *If you bring back twelve Einhasad crosses, I can perform a mass that soothes the spirits of the dead priests.*

Before you go, take this. It is a mark that shows you are performing a holy task for the church of Einhasad.

Well than, I shall pray for your safe return. May the light of Einhasad guide you.
