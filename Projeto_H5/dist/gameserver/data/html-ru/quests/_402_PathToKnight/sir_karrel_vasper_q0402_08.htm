!Sir Klaus Vasper:

Very well. I, Sir Klaus Vasper, the guardian knight of the west, bestow this *Trial of the Apprentice Knight* upon you. Always carry this mark with you while embarking on the trial. This is how people along your pilgrimage will recognize you as an apprentice knight.

As you go around to the villages in the Gludio region, try to meet with the local *guard captain* or the *high priest.* They will suggest many difficult tasks that you may perform for the people. When you complete these tasks, you can obtain a Coin of Lords. If you return with *three or more Coins*, you will have completed your trial.

Then, embark on your journey. May Einhasad's protection be with you.
