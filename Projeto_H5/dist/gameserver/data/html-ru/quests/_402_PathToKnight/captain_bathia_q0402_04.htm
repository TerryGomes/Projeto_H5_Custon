!Captain Bathis:

Oh, so you have killed all the bugbears. Now the traders can safely drive their carts to Dion. Here, take this -- it's a *coin of the lords*.

Now you have the coin in your hand, and I have preserved my dignity as captain of the guards. Wasn't that a good exchange? Ha! Well, have a fine day!
