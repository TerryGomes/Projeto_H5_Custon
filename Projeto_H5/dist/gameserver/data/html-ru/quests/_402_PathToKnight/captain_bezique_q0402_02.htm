!Captain Bezique:

My my ... you are quite stubborn. Fine. If you must play the part of the hero ... why don't you go and hunt the spiders that have been wrecking havoc lately? Giant spiders have recently been reported upturning farmers' carts, raiding sheep and cattle, and even attacking Humans.

The monsters you need to hunt are called *poison spiders, or trimden*. Cut off their legs, then bring back twenty of them and I will give you the coin of the lords. Follow the southern coastal road and you will reach the area where they usually appear. I must follow procedure, so as a captain of the guard, I give you this mark to take with you.

Well then, I hope you return with your life!
