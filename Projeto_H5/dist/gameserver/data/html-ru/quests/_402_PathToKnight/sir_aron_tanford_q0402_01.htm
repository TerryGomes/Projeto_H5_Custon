!Sir Aaron Tanford:

From that mark, I see you are undergoing the Trial of the Esquire. I guess they are giving opportunities to amateurs like you these days? Your courage is admirable but I want to advise you to give up. Do you think just anyone becomes a Knight? Even more, you are not even of noble background, are you?

One cannot become a true Knight without born disposition and talent. It is truly pathetic to see lowly ones struggle to become a Knight.
