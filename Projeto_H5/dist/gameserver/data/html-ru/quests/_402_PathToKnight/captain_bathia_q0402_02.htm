!Captain Bathis:

If you follow the road southeast of the village, you will come to a river that marks the border between Gludio and Dion. There is *a bridge* that crosses the river. Recently, *bugbears raiders* have appeared near the bridge and attacked trader coaches. Already twenty traders have lost their lives, and the goods that were stolen are too numerous to list. The traders have requested funds from the trader's guild headquarters in order to hire mercenaries, but the guild has yet to answer their request.

I would be much obliged if you would get rid of the bugbears. According to the reports, there are about ten bugbears that attacked the trader coaches. Kill them and bring back *ten necklaces*. While on this task, you will be performing an official task of the Gludio guards, so take this with you.
