!High Priestess Levian:

These days, I hear from the guards that the lizardmen appear in great numbers on the western shore of the province ... As you know, they look like lizards but are all evil creatures made by Shilen. The lizard is the descendent of the dragon, which is the ultimate creature of evil.

In addition, the guards say that these lizardmen perform strange sacrifices every night towards the sea. I am sure they are praying to Shilen, who lies asleep in the deep. Gludio is the land of the righteous ones that follow Einhasad. We cannot allow the land to become contaminated by unholy pagan creatures.

In the name of Einhasad, destroy Shilen's evil creatures. Take this mark with you, and strike the lizardmen with your sword of righteousness. *If you return with twenty tokens after killing the lizardmen* I will give you the coin of lords.
