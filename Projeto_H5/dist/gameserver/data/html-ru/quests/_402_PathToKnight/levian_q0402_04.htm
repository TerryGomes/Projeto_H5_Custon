!High Priestess Levian:

Thank you. Now the lizardmen will not dare covet the land of Gludio. When I look at the strange idols of the lizardmen, I get shivers. I am thinking of burning these unholy things.

As we agreed, I will give you the coin of lords. May you always live by the will of Einhasad. Only the spiritual teachings of light will protect you from corruption.

Pray, do not take my advice lightly. I have seen many Knights fall to the apostles of darkness because of arrogance. In the end, they return to the arms of Einhasad as they are cleansed in the flames of the stake, but it is not a desirable fate.
