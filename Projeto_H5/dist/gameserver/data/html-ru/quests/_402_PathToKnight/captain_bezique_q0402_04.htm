!Captain Bezique:

Ho ho, so you've really killed twenty poison spiders! Perhaps I've been too harsh on you. I was just about to organize a team of soldiers to battle the poison spiders, because I thought you weren't coming back. I apologize for being rude.

Here, I give you one of the few coins of the lords I have in my possession. I hope you have a successful quest.
