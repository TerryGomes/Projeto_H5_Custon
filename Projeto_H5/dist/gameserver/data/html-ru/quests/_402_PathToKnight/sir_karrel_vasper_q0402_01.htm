!Sir Klaus Vasper:

Even in this age, there are still young fighters now and then who wish to become a Human Knight. However, most are novices wrapped up in fantasies that they will become hero knights like those from legends. There are not many that have the qualities of a true Knight -- in other words, the courage to sacrifice oneself and the faith to stand up against the absurdities of the world.
