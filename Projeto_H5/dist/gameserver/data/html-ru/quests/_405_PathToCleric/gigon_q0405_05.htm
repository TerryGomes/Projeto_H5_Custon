!Priest Zigaunt:

By any chance, have you heard the rumors that there is a heretical book that criticizes our religion? The book is called *"Understanding of Miracles,"* and it was actually written by a person who used to be a priest. That is why the church wants to take care of this problem quietly.

Can you retrieve the  books that have been sold? Please do it undercover. The beginning of the rumor about this book was the *town of Gludio*. Begin your search there.
