!Priest Zigaunt:

Thank you for your trouble. The church will be very happy. However, we must take care of the fundamental cause of the problem ...

It is the will of the church that the writer of the book must sign a covenant saying that he will not write any more subversive content and that he will not breathe a word to anyone that he was once a priest. His name is *Lionel*. He is supposedly living in retirement on *Talking Island*.

Please meet Lionel and make him sign the covenant. Well then, I thank you in advance. May the light of the heavens lead you to the righteous path.
