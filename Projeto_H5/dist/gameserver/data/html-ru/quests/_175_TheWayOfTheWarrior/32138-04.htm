!Hierarch Kekropus:

Yes, with that kind of will, you may overcome any hardship. You have the spirit and pride necessary for a Fighter.

You must prepare for the ceremony. Go to *Vice Hierarch Perwan at the Cave of Souls* and seek his assistance; then return to me when your preparations have been completed.
