!Hierarch Kekropus:

How are the preparations progressing? I see that you are curious about why we are preparing for this ceremony rather than simply leaving for the hunt.

But you have hunted outside before, so you must know that you may meet a foe stronger than you are or be overcome by a poison you have never before encountered. Through this ceremony, we help ensure the safety of those the participants.

The preparations should be complete by now. Go back to *Perwan in the Cave of Souls*.
