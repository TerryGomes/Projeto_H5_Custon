!Suki:

Good heavens! Oh, my ... ... You're an adventurer, aren't you? You certainly surprised me. Who am I? My name's suki! What am I doing here? Honestly, I fell in love with a wonderful Warrior who came to our town not too long ago. A dark face with a melancholy shadow... Sinewy hands held his sword tight.. He admired my pure heart and then he... he kissed my... Oh my! Some things are better left unsaid... Anyway, when he left, he wouldn't let me go with him, saying that it was too dangerous for me... Although I knew the danger well, I secretly followed him! I got lost and wound up here... The days have been hard here. My skin has grown rough and I haven't eaten in days! I would give anything just to get back home!... Maybe one day you'll be able to help me.%%
