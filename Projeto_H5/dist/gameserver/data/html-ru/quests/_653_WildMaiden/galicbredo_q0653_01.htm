Thank you so much! Thanks to you, my daughter made it home safely. I certainly gave her a good talking-to! I swear, I don't know what I'mg going to do with that girl! I'm afraid something terrible will happen to her someday... Humph! By the way, Take this! It's not much, but think of it as a small token of my appreciation. Thank you again.%%
What's a father to do...
