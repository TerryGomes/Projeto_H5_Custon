!Hierarch Kekropus:

You are an Arbalester, are you not?%%
Thenyou must have learned many secrets in your missions, among them something about our race's ability and purpose...%%
No doubt, though, you have been frustrated that so much was still hidden from you. That was no accident.%%
Even within our race itself, there is a grave secret about our origin. Because of it, we were sealed on this Isle of Souls, trapped between dimensions for ages in order to hide from the wrath of the gods themselves.%%
But now our power is needed to help oppose the growing strength of Shilen and her evil minions.%%
Our hidden island was visited by a man in black armor and a woman in a dazzling blue dress who offered to remove the seal in exchange for our help.
