!Hierarch Kekropus:

This will be a very dangerous and difficult journey.%%
But from what I have seen of you thus far, I think you are up to the challenge.%%
...%%
As I have already said, you will need an object called the Resonance Amulet in order to communicate with the Tablet of Vision.%%
This was created in order to prevent the knowledge of the Tablet from falling into the wrong hands.%%
According to my research, the first Resonance Amulet is in the possession of Magister Justin in Goddard Castle Town. Go find him.%%
Be warned, though: Beleth's minions may also be seeking the Resonance Amulet and may try to stop you.
