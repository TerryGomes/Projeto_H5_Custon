!Hierarch Kekropus:

While Einhasad's forces mercilessly hunted the survivng Giants,%%
the head of the Arviterre research facility struck a deal with another powerful being to hide the remaining Kamael from Einhasad by sealing this island between dimensions.%%
That is how we were removed from the world for so many years.

[Quest _069_SagaOfTheTrickster 0-2|"So...are we still at war with the gods, now that we have been unsealed?"]
