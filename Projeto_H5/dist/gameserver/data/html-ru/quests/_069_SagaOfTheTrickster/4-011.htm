I have avoided pursuing my vendetta against the goddess of light because I hoped that the time would come when I could bequeath this magical stone to one of my heirs capable of attaining true power and insight.%%
Now use that Resonance Amulet wisely.%%
I do not know how you will deal with the truth -- that we were all created as weapons to help the Giants oppose the gods...%%

...%%
I must pursue and destroy our injured enemies...%%
Farewell...
