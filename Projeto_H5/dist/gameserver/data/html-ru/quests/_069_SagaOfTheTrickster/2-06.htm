!Magister Justin:

The Tablets of Vision are scatterd throughout the world.%%
Each requires a different Resonance Amulet in order to communicate with it.%%
This means that the Amulets and Tablets are uniquely paired.%%
The Amulet I have given you matches the first Tablet of Vision, which is located to the south of the Tower of Insolence. Go find it!
