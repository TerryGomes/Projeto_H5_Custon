!Magister Justin:

As a magician and a scholar, my insterest in life energy is extremely keen.%%
While studying the Kamael, I have come to learn about the Tablet of Vision and the existence of the teaching stone.%%
However, journeying to those dangerous places myself in search of the stone is too arduous.%%
Instead, I have found a substitute material that can assist me in my research.
