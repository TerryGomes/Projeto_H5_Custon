!Master Medea:

According to my investigations, this Resonance Amulet can be repaired with the Divine Stone of Wisdom possessed by both Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos.%%
But I cannot leave here.%%
I know you are on a quest to find the Tablets, so this is a task well suited for you.%%
Both the Ketra Orcs and the Varka Silenos have a Divine Stone of Wisdom.%%
You must earn one tribe's trust obtain their Stone.%%
Which tribe will you choose?
