!Hierarch Kekropus:

Hmm...something like that happened, eh?%%
...%%Then I should tell you the truth...%%
Long, long ago, we were created to be living weapons with which the Giants might oppose the gods.%%
That is the secret of our race.%%
Because of this, we were sealed between dimensions for ages...%%
(Kekropus stares of into space, apparently deep in reminiscence.)%%
A long, long time ago, following the great civil war between the gods, the Giants began to become disillusioned about the gods' rule. They built a mighty empire, developing thier science to a level that the world had never seen.%%
To protect themselves from the gods, they also began to develop weapons capable of harming the gods themselves.%%
They used what they had discovered during the war of the gods to unlock the secrets of life itself.%%
We, the Kamael, are the result of the Giants' experiments to create life independent of the gods and their wheel of fate.%%
Although we have not the raw power of the Giants, much less the gods, because we were created outside of the natural order we, more than any other creatures, are able to oppose the gods.%%
Just as even the mightiest beast can be felled by a drop of deadly poison, so we were created to be a poisoned dagger to fell the gods themselves...
