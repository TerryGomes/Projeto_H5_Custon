!Tablet of Vision:

Thoughts beyond your understanding race through you mind, and you hear the faint whisper of a female voice.%%
You sense the existence of the next Resonance Amulet; it is being held by the Crimson Duchess, a follower of Beleth, who is near the Tablet located southeast of the Ketra Orc Outpost.%%
You cannot fight them by normal means, so you must gain more information from Kekropus' report.
