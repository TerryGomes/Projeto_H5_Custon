!Magister Alminas:

After I obtained the Resonance Amulet, I examined it in some detail.%%
While I do not know its exact composition, I do know that it was made from some material that Gran Kain cherished dearly.%%
Halisha, one of the rulers of Hell, is said to use this very same material. Perhaps you could get it by defeating his Minions or Archon?%%
Luckily, I have heard that Halisha is now sending many of his minions to the Four Sepulchers. If I were you, I would hurry there.%%
Hmm... the evil creatures in the Shrine of Loyalty are also Minions of Halisha. Perhaps they also have the material you seek.%%
Once you've obtained it, go to the Tablet in the southwest portion of the Wall of Argos.
