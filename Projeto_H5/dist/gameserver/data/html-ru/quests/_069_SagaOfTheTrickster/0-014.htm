!Hierarch Kekropus:

When war broke out, the 3 heroes of the Kamael, the Spicula, joined the Giants along with other Kamael.%%
They fought well, helping shift the tide of battle in the Giants' favor.%%
Mighty Harkilgamed wielded the great sword Enuma Elisha and slew Einhasad's second daughter, while%%
Katenar bombarded the goddess' army with the huge gannon, Leopold.%%
Meanwhile, Rodenpicula used the impenatrable Shield of Light to ward off all attacks on the Kamael.%%
Thatnks to the Kamael, Einhasad and her soldiers were forced to retreat, abandoning her celestial palace. The Giants believed that they had won...%%
But Einhasad, nearly out of her mind with rage, obtained the Hammer of the Stars, a weapon almost unbelievably destructive, and used it to rain huge fireballs upon Grande Peron, the Giants' capital.%%
Whole portions of the continent sank into the sea, and within a day the mightiest empire the world had ever seen was no more.
