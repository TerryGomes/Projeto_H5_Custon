!Magister Alminas:

Have you come in search of the Resonace Amulet?%%
I came upon it by chance while exploring some ancient ruins in the course of my research.%%
I would like to help you, but my Resonance Amulet is currently installed as an activation device for a prototype weapon that I am developing.%%
Since it is already completely synchronized, I'm afraid that it wouldn't be of any use to you.
