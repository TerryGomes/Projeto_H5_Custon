!Guard Pinaps:

The Sel Mahums are training for war, it's up to us to keep the peace. But we need to know more about their training operation. I cannot leave my post, I'm duty bound. I'll need your help. Get the <font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum training schedule from the training instructor</font> and bring it here.

Then bring the <font color="LEVEL">Sel Mahum training log new privates and Sel Mahum soldiers carry</font>.
