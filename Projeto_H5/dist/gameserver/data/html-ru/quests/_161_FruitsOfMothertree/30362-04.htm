!Andellia:

Thank you so much. First, take this letter. Show it to *Thalia* and she will know that I sent you. Get the Mother Tree fruit from her and bring it back to me. Please hurry, as the fruit may spoil. We cannot make nectar from spoiled fruit.

Just follow the southern path from the village to reach Lake Iris. My sister Thalia lives in the small observatory on the eastern lake shore.

Thank you in advance and please send her my regards.
