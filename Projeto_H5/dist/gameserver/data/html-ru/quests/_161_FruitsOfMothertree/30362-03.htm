!Andellia:

My sisters and I are in charge of taking care of the young Mother Trees in the forest. It is our joy in life to take care of the Mother Trees in all four seasons while keeping company with the creatures of the beautiful Elven Forest. The nectar that gives us children of the forest our nearly eternal lives is made from the *fruit of the Mother Tree*.

Fruit harvests have been gradually decreasing lately, and I think it is because of the spores that spread to our woods from the Sea of Spores on the other side of the mountain.

A few days ago, I received a letter from my younger sister, Thalia, that the Mother Tree near Lake Iris had borne fruit. We sisters cannot travel far from our Mother Trees, as we must stay close and maintain our tie to it. My sister has probably finished her harvest by now. Would you be able to travel there and bring back the fruit from her?

No one but us sisters may harvest the Mother Tree's fruits, and it is a rare opportunity to be able to see a real Mother Tree fruit in person.
