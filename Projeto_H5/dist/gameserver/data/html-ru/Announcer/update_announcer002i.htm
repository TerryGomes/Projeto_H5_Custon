The Monastery of Silence is silent no more. This area has been reconstructed so that only adventurers <font color="LEVEL">|level 83 or above</font> may wish to enter.

Einhasad's priests have now found new faith and follow that of Saint Solina.

As adventurers know, the Monastery of Silence has been the fortress which protects the Holy Grail. Many have ventured to retrieve this relic, yet none have returned.

There are rumors that there is a treasure that randomly appears in the Monastery of Silence, but nothing more than that. Also, it is said that the Monks inside will not attack unarmed foes. That might be worth remembering...
