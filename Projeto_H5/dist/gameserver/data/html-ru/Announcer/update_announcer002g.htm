A new tune can be heard from the depths of the Emperor's Tomb. Frintezza's new arrangement has made his minions much stronger than they were. Only veterans <font color="LEVEL">|level 84 or above</font> should even think about entering the Emperor's Tomb.

A good place to get started is by completing the quest Four Goblets and go from there.
