!News Informer:

A new seed has emerged in the Gracia continent. The Seed of Annihilation is best suited for adventurers <font color="LEVEL">|level 85</font>. This area will challenge any adventurer who steps on its ground.

Three races control the three different areas of the seed. These races are called the Bistakon, Reptilikon, and Kokracon.

Just like the other seeds, the status of the Seed of Annihilation can be changed by the actions of those who fight. Istina, who is at the center of the Seed of Annihilation, has a special relationship between her and the creatures that exist in the Seed of Annihilation. In order to defeat her, you will need to defeat the leaders of the tribes on the Seed of Annihilation.

People in Keucereus Alliance Base may be able to help you.
