!News Informer:

New discoveries have been made in Pavel Ruins. Adventurers <font color="LEVEL">|level 72 or above</font> are best suited for this journey. A warning, though - Doctor Chaos and the feared Golem Corps has been sighted there. Doctor Chaos may have failed to conquer the world, but defeat has left a bitter taste. Rumors say he has teamed up with a new villain...

Another rumor is that Doctor Chaos is using the Fire of Pa'agrio to create a more advanced golem. These golems are incredibly strong and very dangerous. Thought you should know if you happen to come across one and wonder why you are getting torn apart.
