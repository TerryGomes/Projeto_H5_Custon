!Fishing Guild Member Berix:

Hello there! Pleased to meet you! I'm Berix, a member of the Fishermen's Guild. There are more than hunters here in Hunters Village! Ha! This town also boasts many excellent fishermen! Like me, for example! Har har!!

Well, that's at least halfway true. Well, do you want to catch a big fish today or what? You shouldn't miss this opportunity with this great weather we're having!
