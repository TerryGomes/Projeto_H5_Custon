!Fishing Guild Member O'Fulle:

The name's O'Fulle! I'm a member of the local Fishermen's Guild. I'm the one you should see about any fishing needs you may have while in Giran!

Giran has it all! Lots of money and great fishing! Why don't you give it a try?

Good luck! I hope you catch a whopper! Make sure not to catch any mermaids, though! They're nothing but trouble! Ha!
