Welcome! Welcome to the Ivory Tower!

This place is widely regarded as some sort of hideout for Wizards, but there are many non-Wizards who also come and go as they please. Originally, in fact, I was a Paladin sworn to the service of Einhasad. Don't mistake me -- I haven't betrayed my oath!

Just so you know, odd things do often happen at this Tower -- don't go snooping where you don't belong, no matter how curious you become. It could be dangerous.
