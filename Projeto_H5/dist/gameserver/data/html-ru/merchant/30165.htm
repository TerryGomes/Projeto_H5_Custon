You look like you've been doing a lot of traveling. Did you happen to pass through the Elven Village? How is everyone there? Ah, I really miss it.

Oh, what am I doing, saying these sorts of things to a customer! Please pardon my thoughtlessness. Ah, every item you see here was actually produced in the Tower. Feel free to check for yourself!
