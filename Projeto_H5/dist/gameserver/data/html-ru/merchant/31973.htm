!Spellbook Seller Raheel:

Welcome! You seem like a well-seasoned traveler! Have you been to Talking Island? Do you have any news from there? I've always wanted to go there and practice magic, but I have a family to feed, so I'm stuck here selling spellbooks. But who knows? Perhabs one day I'll become a famous magican!

Oh, well... Enough dreaming... Have you found what you were seeking?
