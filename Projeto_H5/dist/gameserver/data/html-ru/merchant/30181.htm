!Trader Galibredo:

Where did you come from, youngster? What are you looking for?

No, no, I am not talking about goods... I'm curious about how you ended up here...

Oh, never mind. Old habits die hard. You must think me a doddering old fool, eh? Well, you might be right. But everything we sell is in good shapre, at least!
