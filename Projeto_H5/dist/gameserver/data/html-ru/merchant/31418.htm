!Spellbook Seller Rouke:

Seeker of truth, may Einhasad's sacred light shine on your path...

The first step of seeking truth lies in books. Look around here and find one that appeals to you.

Now that magic is no longer limited to these books, I think they are even more precious. Find a tome that can better your life and cherish it!
