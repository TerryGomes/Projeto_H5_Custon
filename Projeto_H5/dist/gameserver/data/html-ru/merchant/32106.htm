I don't know if you know this, but this wharf was once so ridiculously shabby it couldn't even be properly called a wharf! Compared to then, it's a heck of a lot better now.

I still get a chill down my back thinking about those days...

From time to time, those horrifying dinosaurs would even charge down from the jungle to devour the settlers. Now you see me as an old wharf manager, but back then I was just a hot-blooded young adventurer like you spoiling for a fight! Some days I was ready to tear into them with my bare hands. Of course, then I saw what they could do to the unskilled... Ah, but I still miss the days of my youth.
