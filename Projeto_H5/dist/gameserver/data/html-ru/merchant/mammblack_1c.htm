Do you know about the Foundation Items? Even we blacksmiths see them only infrequently.<br>

These uncommon items are brought into being by a power than goes beyond mere chance. We Dwarves say that it is the blessing of Maphr.<br>

That perfect craftsmanship is beyond the Human race's capacity.It is not, however, beyond mine.<br>

Bring me <font color="LEVEL">Mammon's Varnish Enhancer, which is sold by the Merchant of Mammon</font>. <br>

Then I will use techniques known only to me to transform the item into something accessible to mortals.<br>

Be sure to select a helmet among the rare items that provides you with a useful power. <br>

Don't worry if you make the wrong choice, though. You will have another chance to make a selection.<br>
