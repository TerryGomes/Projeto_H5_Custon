For the honor of the eternal flame! Hello, brothers of fire!

Have you seen the outside world? It's much greater than you could ever have imagined! It's good to have high ambitions, but skills only come through continuous practice, for the sake and honor of our tribe! Take as much time as you want, have a good look around! No rush! We have all the time in the world!
