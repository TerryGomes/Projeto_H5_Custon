!Kitzka:

Dragon Valley is an enormous canyon ruled by the dragons and drakes. The souls of those who resisted Antharas and fought against him turned into the undead there - they are bound there and left to await their end. The monsters become stronger as you get deeper into the valley, so you MUST proceed with caution!

There has been some severe crust movement lately in the Dragon Valley, so the dragons and  their hatchlings are frequently moving their nests. If you see a Shiny Dragon Herd during an earthquake, be sure to grab hold! The dragons carry gold and valuables in their bodies when they move their nest - if you are lucky, you might be able to obtain some rare items!
