Feed Seller:

Welcome to the Beast Farm! Anyone can raise a beast in this place. If you are lucky, that beast will then tamely follow you. If you are not so lucky, well...you better hope you can defeat the creature!

Anyway, I sell feed for beasts here: *Golden Spice* and *Crystal Spice*.

Golden Spice helps beasts grow larger, while Crystal Spice helps bones and skins become tougher. If you want a beast to become rich, feed it Golden Spice. If you want to raise it strong, feed it Crystal Spice.

Why not buy both and compare their effects?
