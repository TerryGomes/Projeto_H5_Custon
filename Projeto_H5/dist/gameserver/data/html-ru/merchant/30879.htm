!Wharf Manager Felton:

This wharf is visited by many ships and boats both near and far from other ports of the continent including the wharf in Talking Island. Without this wharf, even the gigantic market in Giran would not be able to function in normal capacity. Currently, only the passengers of regular liners, traders business people and a few fishermen use this wharf and it seems that the wharf is not that busy. But soon a village is going to be established near this wharf. I heard a rumor that dwarves are already funding the project. Since the foundation for a village has already been laid out, the only thing left is an order from the lord.
