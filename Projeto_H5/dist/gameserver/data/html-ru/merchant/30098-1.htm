Ah, you have excellent taste! This bracelet is truly unique. In fact, it is said that it contains an *Agathion*. Quite a find, eh? Wondering if it is for sale? Of course it is -- that's why I'm here!

Both this *Little Angel Agathion Bracelet* and this *Little Devil Agathion Bracelet* where discovered by another group of adventurers while exploring some acient ruins. I am positive that they contain Agathions! Of cource, no one knows for sure the power an Agathion possesses or how long it lasts. I have been reluctant to experiment on them because it's clear that some of the bracelets possess only limited magic power.

Others have more, however. What you get will depend on your luck, I'm afraid.

If you wish to buy either the Little Angel Bracelet or the Little Devil Bracelet, bring me *25 Big Red Nimble Fish, 50 Great Codrans, 4 Memento Moris, 5 Earth Eggs, 5 Nonliving Nucleus, 3 Dragon Hearts*, and *7,500,000 Adena*. Iwish I could part with them in exchange for crystals as normally would, but the adventurers who deliveres the bracelets here insisted on these other items for payment. Even so, I still believe this is a reasonable price. After all, an Agathion isn't something you run across every day, eh? So, would you like to buy one?
