!Wharf Manager Clency:

Welcome. Do you want to get aboard? Now we have quite a number of routes here at Gludin. We even had a test operation on the route to the Elmore kingdom, with whom we once were at odds. Now we have regular liners and shuttles as there has been a growing number of users to the pleasure of me.

Would you try a regular liner ship to the Rune Township of Elmore? It is on a regular schedule.
