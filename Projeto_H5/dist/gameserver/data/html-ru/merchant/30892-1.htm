What, you haven't heard? Is this your first visit to Innadril? The Sword is the symbol of the Lord of Innadril. It is filled with history. Several decades ago, the water dragon Fafurion rose up and caused great devastation in these parts. Then Lionel, the hunter, he was just a young lad at that time...well, he faced the dragon -- without armor, mind you -- and somehow put the dragon to sleep. The Goddess Eva was so thankful that she gave him a magic sword. In the years that followed, it became the symbol for the Lord of Innadril. That is the *Sword of Othelotte*.

But recently the sword has disappeared... No one, not even the lord himself, knows its whereabouts. And now Giran is scuttling its trade agreements with us, claiming that without the sword there is no rightful lord in Innadril and the treaties are invalidated...
