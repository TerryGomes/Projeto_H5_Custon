!Amulet Seller Shafa:

Welcome, ye who follow the cry of fire! I am Shafa, daughter of Paagrio! What is your business with me? Speak up! Do you seek the power of a bear? Or perhaps the patience of a hunting spider? Would you like to run like a wolf, faster than the wind? Amulets can bring you all of these things!
