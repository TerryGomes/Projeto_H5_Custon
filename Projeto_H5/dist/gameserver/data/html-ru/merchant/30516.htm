!Trader Reep:

Hello, my name is Reep -- I'm the manager here at the Golden Wheel, a shop dedicated providing you with excellent service and selection.

Always happy to see a new customer!

Please browse our wide selection of items.

Remember, more expensive items are not necessarily better than cheaper ones. How can you tell? Well, every adventurer has his or her methods, of course. But the most important thing is your judgement and experience about whether the item will match your needs.

Heh, can you tell the true value of the items displayed here?
