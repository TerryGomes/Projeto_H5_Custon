!Arena Manager:

Only parties whith more than 7 members can patricipate is the game and, if they win, keep playing. You can also only patricipate in the arena reserved for your level When you enter the arena, you will see a Tower of Resurrection for each team.

Until you destroy your opponents' tower, it will continue to resurresct them.Take a look around the arena to understand how it will affect the battle. This is about more than simple combat, you know...

Remember also that any buff applied to the team will be negated if one of the members does not meet its level requirements. Another bit of advice: consider stationing the team member who is best at solo matches on the front line.

Now, then -- ready to prove just now good you really are?
