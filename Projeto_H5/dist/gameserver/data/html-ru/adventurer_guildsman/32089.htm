Well, well, well! The Lord finally defeated the raid boss, huh? That must've been a hell-of-a show! I wish I'd seen that! I had to come and see for myself when I heard the news!

Surely you've heard that our guild is collecting Life Crystals?! Bring some and I'll make a splendind, unique item for you!
