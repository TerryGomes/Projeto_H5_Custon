!Event Manager Winnie the Cat:
Wow! *Are you really a fox level collector?* Meow! I wouldn't have known at first glance, but now that I get a closer look at you,
I can see it in your eyes! I'm sure your'e already familiar with the game, so I'll keep the explanation brief... *If you wish to become a wolf level collector,
pay me 40 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you! Meow!* You can play as many times as you want, as long as you have enough glittering medals.
The game tests both your abilities and your luck, the two essential qualities of a collector! Meow!
