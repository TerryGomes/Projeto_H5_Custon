!Event Manager Winnie the Cat:

Ah, a *rabbit*, eh? *To raise your level to hyena, pay me 10 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you!*
Meow! The game is a test of both your luck and skill, the two essential qualities of a collector. Meow!
Your abilities are evaluated by the number of glittering medals you collect, and your luck is tested by how often you win the game.
If you lose, pay 10 more glittering medals and try again! You'll eventually win. Meow!! Would you like to give it a try?
