!Event Manager Winnie the Cat:

A *no level collector*, eh?
*If you'd like to try to raise your level, give me 5 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you! Meow!*
If you lose, you can always try again! The game will help you develop the qualities you'll need as a collector.
Meow! Your abilities are evaluated by the number of glittering medals you collect and your luck is tested by the number of times you win the game.
You can play as long as you have glittering medals! Meow!! Would you like to give it a try?
