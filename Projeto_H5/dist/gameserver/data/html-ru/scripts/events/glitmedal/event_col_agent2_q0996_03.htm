!Event Manager Winnie the Cat:
*Ah, a hyena, eh?* I know you've been working hard, so I'll keep the explanation brief. *If you wish to become a fox level collector,
pay me 20 glittering medals and I'll play a game with you! Meow!*
You can play as many times as you want, as long as you have enough glittering medals! This game tests your ablities as well as your luck.
Meow! Your abilities are evaluated by the number of glittering medals you collect and your luck is tested by the number of times you win the game!
