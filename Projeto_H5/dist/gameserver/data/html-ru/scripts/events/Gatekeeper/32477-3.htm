Well, aren't you kind...

Your encouragement and support gives us even more strength.

As a token of our gratitude, we will allow you to change your appearance to look like us. I should warn you though: unlike using a Gatekeeper Transformation Stick, you won't be able to display any real power with this regular appearance change.
