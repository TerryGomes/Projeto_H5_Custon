You can use Gatekeeper Transformation Stick to transform yourself to look like us for an entire hour!

When you use Gatekeeper Transformation Stick to look like us, you will possess our great powers and you will gain vitality while hunting. It's fantastic!

You can obtain a Gatekeeper Transformation Stick once a day per account for a donation of just 10,000 Adena. All proceeds go to the Gatekeeper Welfare Foundation, so please participate early and often!

Please know that during the transformation, your physical form and your attributes will change.
