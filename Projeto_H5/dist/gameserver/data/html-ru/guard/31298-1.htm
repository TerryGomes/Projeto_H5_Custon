!Guard Ulrich:

Well, I'm just a guard, so I don't really know anything for sure... But I've heard people talk! When the giants were defeated after rebelling against the gods, Argos, the giant with 1,000 eyes, was buried alive in that valley! All those eyes embedded in the stone wall belong to him. When some of them fell off the wall, they became floating monster eyes.
