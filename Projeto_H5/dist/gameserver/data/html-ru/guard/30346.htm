!Sentry Kayleen:

Greetings. Have you seen many places? My wish is to adventure in the wide, outside world someday. When I give up my job as sentry, I am thinking of traveling to Elmore. If you go there, there is the village of *Pabell* built by Dark Elves.

Maybe it's just because of the oppressive atmosphere that hangs around the *School of Dark Arts*, but sometimes my wish seems a very remote possibility.
