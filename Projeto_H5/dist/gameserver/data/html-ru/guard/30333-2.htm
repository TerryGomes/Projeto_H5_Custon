!Guard Praga:

Gludin is a large port village on the southwest coast. Ships to Talking Island depart from there regularly.

If you want to go to the village of Gludin, take this road west until you come to a fork in the road, then take the road that goes southwest. You have to pass the Abandoned Camp, where ol mahum deserters are encamped, so be particularly careful.
