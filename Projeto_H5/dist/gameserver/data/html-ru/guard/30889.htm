!Frontier Post Rowan:

Aren't you a suspicious fellow! Why are you here?  Where are you from?  You have a peculiar accent.  Could it be that you are a spy from Elmore?

We have had a lot of trouble with foreigners lately, especially ones from Rune and Lansk.  Recently some spies from Rune were posing as brigands in this area, causing a lot of havoc... You wouldn't be one of them, would you?

Well, you don't look like them. You may go!
