!Praetorian Rukain:

*Immortal Plateau*! The region where our Orcs live is called the Immortal Plateau. Originally, it was a sacred place for worshipping our ancestors. However, 2,000 years ago we were defeated by the Elves and we settled here to live.

You, young Orc, you have to gain power so that our kind will never be disgraced again. Do you understand?
