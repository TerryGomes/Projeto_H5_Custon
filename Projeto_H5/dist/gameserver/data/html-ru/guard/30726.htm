!Guard Tebose:

If you leave through this door and head south you'll arrive at Oren Castle and the town of Oren. Have you come from the south? If so, I've told you useless information. Would you like to know about the Ivory Tower?

I know a secret about the tower... A close Mystic friend of mine told me when he was drunk and the next day he vanished from the tower. How about it, are you still curious?
