!Marksman Syzar:

Mimir's Forest leads to Nornil's Cave. According to legend, it was named after Mimir, the great Giant who planted the Seed of Creation.

But the important thing for you to remember is that that forest is a dangerous place. And that nest of monsters, Nornil's Cave, will be even worse. Are you prepared?
