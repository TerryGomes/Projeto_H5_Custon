!Guard Hanson:

You want to know about the giants of ere? 
I'm sorry, but I don't know much about them myself. 
All I know is that they lived in these lands a 
long time ago and that their knowledge was far greater than ours.

Now that I think about it, perhaps the Elves know, 
since they've been around longer than the Humans.
