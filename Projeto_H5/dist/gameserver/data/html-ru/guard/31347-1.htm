Shh! Keep your voice down! Do you want to get us in trouble?!

Don't tell anyone you heard this from me, you understand? Elmore is facing its greatest crisis ever! Devil-worshippers have infiltrated the aristocracy! They can also be found at the highest levels of the government of Elmore! These heathens worship the devil Triol! They actually aspire to conquer the entire kingdom.
