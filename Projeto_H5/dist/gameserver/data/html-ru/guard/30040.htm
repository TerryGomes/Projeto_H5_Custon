!Guard Leon:

Welcome to the Talking Island Village! I am Leon, one of the guards here. Our duty is to protect the village from the invasion of Orcs or werewolves and punish those who violate the laws of this kingdom.

Those who harm others are dealt with severely according to the orders of the king. You may think it is merciless, but I think that those who injure others deserve the same.
