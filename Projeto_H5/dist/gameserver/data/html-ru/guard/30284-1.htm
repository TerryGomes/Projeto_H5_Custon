!Sentinel Knight Smallberry:

Sentinels are also called the guardians of the forest, or watchmen of the fresh green. We are fighters who have guarded the Elven Forest from outside threats for hundreds of years. The orcs of the Fog Mountains, greedy Humans trying to increase their land, and our dark Elven brothers of the north -- all have attacked this place many times. Each time we defend ourselves, and they learn a harsh lesson about underestimating the sentinels.

Once there were many sentinels, not only around the village, but also posted as lookouts on the boundaries of the forest. However, now there are less than one hundred sentinels, so we rely on the *guardians* to defend the forest beyond the village.
