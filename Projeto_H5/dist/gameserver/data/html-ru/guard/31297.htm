Hey there, stranger! Are you an adventurer? Really! Most outsiders I've seen lately have been  from the south!

Do you have any exciting stories to tell of your adventures? Heard any interesting rumors? I've heard talk that there's been quite a commotion in the *hot springs area* and in the *Gods' Cauldron*!
