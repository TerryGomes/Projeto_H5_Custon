!Guard Weisz:

They say Giran is the wealthiest region in the kingdom. Once, I traveled to Giran escorting the coaches of some traders, and their market was enormous. Traders from all over the continent were selling all sorts of novelties. I am thinking of going back there someday to buy a dress of Avella silk for my wife.
