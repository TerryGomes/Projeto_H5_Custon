Yes, sir! All present and accounted for, sir!

Hey!? Who the hell are you? I thought you were my captain!!!

Dammit! I must be losing my mind! Why else would I have listened to Andrei's ravings? And don't get me started about the foreigners!

I'll go crazy if I stay here! That Valacas expedition team is looking better all the time!

Move along! You're blocking traffic!
