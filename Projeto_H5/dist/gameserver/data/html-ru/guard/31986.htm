Brrr! It's freezing out here! Nothing like a mug of Kofporch to thicken the blood on a day like this. What? You've never heard of Kofporch? Where've you been, kiddo? Were you born yesterday?

Kofporch is only brewed in a few areas in Schutgart Territory. The best kids are then hauled out and left to age in either the *Den of Evil* or the *Crypts of Disgrace*. Dangerous? Sure! But believe you me, no imitation even comes close!
