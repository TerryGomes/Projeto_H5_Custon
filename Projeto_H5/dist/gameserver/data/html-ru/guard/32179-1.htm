!Marksman Putin:

Nornill's Cave is widely known as the origin of all the monsters who roam the Isle of Souls. Survive it and you will gain the qualifications necessary to depart this island for the mainland as a soldier of the Kamael,

To be honest, even if yo don't pass you may still be able to leave the island, but this is the traditional path, and tradition is something we Kamael value.
