The harbor was originally made to allow contact between the Isle of Souls and the mainland.

Initially, there were many goods that flowed through here, but no ships come here now. It is better, you see, for the adventurers who come here to use the gatekeeper's side.

If you go there, I'm sure you will find a gatekeeper preparing to go to the mainland.
