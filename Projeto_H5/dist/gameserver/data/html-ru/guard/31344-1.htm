!Guard Schmidt:

The *Swamp of Screams*? It's a very dangerous place.

The stakatos are ferocious and the water in the swamp is poisonous. I hear you become addicted when you get near the water, you don't even have to drink it!

The Golden Ram Mercenary Force was hired to wipe them out. Best to use the experts, you'd need a miracle to survive there!
