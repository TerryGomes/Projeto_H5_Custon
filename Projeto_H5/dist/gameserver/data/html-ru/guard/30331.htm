!Guard Thoma:

Our captain is a bit gullible. He says we must stick to military discipline because we serve so near the lord s castle. I don t think someone as high as the lord would care about what one guard wears&

What do you think? Is there any need to lecture us about what we should wear? Don't they say substance is more valuable than appearance& Of course, everybody prefers it when things look nice and neat.
