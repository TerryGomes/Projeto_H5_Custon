!Sentry Nelsya:

In a few days the *mass of darkness* dedicated to Shilen and Gran Kain will be held. Shilen's Hunt will be held for ten days before the mass. The purpose of his ceremony is to hunt wild animals in the name of the goddess and offer them as a sarcrifice at the sanctuary. Of course, the act of offering a sarcrifice is only symbolic - in thepast, the hunt's purpose was also to acquire supplies for the winter during our long period of hiding in the darkness. The hunt has already begun! The youth of the village are in the woods and on the hunt, armed with swords and bows. The fervor is impressive - the Humans who witnessed it called it the "wild hunt". I think you should also hurry and participate in the hunt to honor the mother of the abyss!
