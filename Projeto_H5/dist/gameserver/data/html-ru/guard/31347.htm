You picked a bad time to visit Rune, my friend. People like you may help ease my workload, but... Oh, well... Come closer... Shhhh...

...Have you heard any strange rumors? You must keep this to yourself! There's a vast conspiracy afoot against the kingdom! If you hear anything about this plot, come and tell me at once!
