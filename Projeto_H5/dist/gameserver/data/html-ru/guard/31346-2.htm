!Guard Sirius:

The *von Hellmanns* were aristocrats who ruled the manor in the eastern section of Rune. They gained power after their distinguished service in the war with Aden. But the revolt was their undoing! They were all brutally massacred! Now the mere mention of their name can be deadly... Watch what you say around here!

If you visit the *Forest of the Dead*, you should really be careful! Legend says that the von Hellmann Family has all turned into *blood-drinking creatures* roaming about the forest. Oh well, one shouldn't listen to rumors, I suppose... But you can't be too careful!
