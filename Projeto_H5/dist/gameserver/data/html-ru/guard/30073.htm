!Guard Jacob:

How do you do, honored traveler? Have you come to our village to see the great shell of *cruma*? If you have, then you'd be well advised to give up your search. Many have come to this village to view the shell of cruma, but I have rarely seen anyone return from that place intact. The *Marshlands* where the shell of cruma lies have for ages been a place teeming with monsters -- even our guards don't like to go near there.
