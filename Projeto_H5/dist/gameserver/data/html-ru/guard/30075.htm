!Guard Xaber:

Hey, stranger. If you are going to Giran, don t wander off this road along the way. If you leave the path for a even moment, you could suffer an unlucky mishap with the *runaway troops.* They are wicked and violent criminals, so before you leave, go to the temple and pray to Einhasad that you never meet them.
