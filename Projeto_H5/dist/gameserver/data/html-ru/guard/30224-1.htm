!Sentry Knight Rayla:

Sentries are guardians who protect the Dark Forest from invaders. We also escort the Tetrarchs and carry out the laws to punish those who have broken the commandments.

They say the Elves of light also have guards called Sentinels. But please, do not compare us with the weak Elves.
