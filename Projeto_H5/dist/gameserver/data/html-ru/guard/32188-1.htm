The Nornil's Cave houses the 3 goddesses of destiny as well as Nornil, caretaker of the Kamael.

It is also the origin of most of the monsters who inhabit the Isle of Souls. Once in our lives, we Kamael must venture into the Cave to meet the 3 goddesses. Until that day comes, train your body, mind and spirit in preparation!
