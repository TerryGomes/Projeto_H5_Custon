!Commander of the Border Patrol, Gregory Athebaldt:

I'm Gregory Athebaldt, commander of the border patrol of Aden kingdom.

Currently, the forces of both countries are massing near the border. Although the border is open, the tension between the countries has resurfaced. You'd better watch your back, my friend!
