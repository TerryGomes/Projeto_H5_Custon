!Guard Tavillian:

Greetings! Welcome to the Ivory Tower!

Hmm... Traveler, did you cross the northern border? What's it like there? One of my friends who works at the checkpoint said the area is in a state of emergency. He can't even go out freely...

I'm worried that something bad will happen so soon after our war with Elmore. My little sister is lives in that region... Damn it! I wish she wasn't so far away!

[npc_%objectId%_Chat 1|Can you tell me about how the tower is structured?]

[npc_%objectId%_Chat 2|Nothing much will happen]
