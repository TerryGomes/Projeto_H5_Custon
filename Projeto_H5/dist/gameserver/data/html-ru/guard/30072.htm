!Guard Metty:

Ahh... What is it?! Can't you see I'm on duty? This soldier has no time to chatter leisurely with the likes of you, country wanderer. Don't be a nuisance. Do me a favor and disappear from my sight.

Hey, country bumpkin! There is a village that suits the likes of you. If you follow this road in front of me you will come to a village called *Floran.* It s a country village that is suitable for a hillbilly like you.
