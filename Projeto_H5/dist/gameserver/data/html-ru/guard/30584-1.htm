Kakai, the Paagrio Lord, is a great Orc. It was amazing to see him duel with Raoul, the King of Men a long time ago. They were well-matched in combat. Raoul was a great man, too. He is responsible for uniting Aden. I can't believe such a great warrior died like that... When Lord Kakai heard the news, he looked genuinely sad.
