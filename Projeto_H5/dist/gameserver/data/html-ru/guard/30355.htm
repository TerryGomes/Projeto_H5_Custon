!Sentry Roselyn:

May the blessing of darkness shelter you. I am Sentry Roselyn, one of the members of the glorious corps of sentries, who protect the Temple of Shilen and guard her people.

This path that I am in charge of leads to the surface. Follow the path and go outside to get to the most sacred site for our race, the *Temple of Shilen.*
