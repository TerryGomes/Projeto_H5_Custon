!Guard Bright:

Look here, are you going to the *Mandragora Farms* by any chance? If I were you, I'd think again about visiting there. It's a very unsettling place.

The owner is *Aaron Nightshade*. No one knows where he comes from or what he used to do. There are more than a few things about him that are fishy. Anyway, if I were you, I would never go there.
