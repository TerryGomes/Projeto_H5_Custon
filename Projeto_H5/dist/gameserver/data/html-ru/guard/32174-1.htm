!Marksman Maddy:

Once you leave the village, the only person who can guarantee your safety is you.

The main threat is monsters, but there are also some adventurers out there that may attack you.

If you choose to fight a monster, well, that's your choice and I wish you well. But if you are being chased by a murderer, I don't think there's any shame in you trying to flee back to the safety of the village.
