!Guard Ballard:

The *Monastery of Silence* was established by the *Order of Saint Solina*, a branch of the Einhasad Temple.

Other travelers have said that it has a very austere and quiet atmosphere. The monks rarely speak with outsiders. Since it's in the middle of nowhere, it's a wonderful place for quiet meditation.
