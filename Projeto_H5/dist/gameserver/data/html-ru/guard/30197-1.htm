!Guard Heiac:

The Ivory Tower is a well-known hideout for Mages. They are always up to something! The legend is that long ago, during the Elmoraden Empire, the magicians there controlled the whole continent! Fortunately today we are ruled by a proper King and Lord. It is said that the Mages resent this...

If you wish to know more, you should visit the Ivory Tower or just ask the Mages.
