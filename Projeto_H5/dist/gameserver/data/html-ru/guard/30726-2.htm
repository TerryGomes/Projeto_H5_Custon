!Guard Tebose:

Shhh! Who knows... Many have heard this story besides you. I know, it sounds crazy... But if I vanish like my friend, will anyone notice? Maybe that is why I'm still alive?

Or, perhaps everything I said was nonsense and my friend got drunk and went to the Tower of Oman to look at the stars...

And you, what do you think?
