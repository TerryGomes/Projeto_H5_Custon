!Guard Bret:

Having the capital city so close to the border like this kind of makes me uncomfortable... We're currently under a ceasefire but if Elmore were to attack, the border forces would not be able to put up any resistance at all. There was some talk about opening the border but something happened so that the border restrictions have started to be enforced even more than before. I sure hope that nothing happens to start the war all over again...
