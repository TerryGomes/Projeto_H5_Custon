!Sentinel Starden:

May the song of stars give you happiness.I am Starden, one of the sentinels who protect the forest,the Mother Tree Glade, and Elves of light.

If my expression looks dark, then forgive me. Originally, I was a cheerful elf who enjoyed poetry and singing, but now I've lost all my former optimism since I went through the war. I had to look upon the sight of my friends being brutally killed by the Dark Elves at the *final battle of the Underground Fortress* ... I try hard to forget the fear and sorrow of those times, but I still have nightmares once in a while.
