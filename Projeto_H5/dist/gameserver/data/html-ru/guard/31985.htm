Ha! if you're lost, I'm your man! I was born and raised here! I know every nook and cranny of Schuttgart! Hee, hee. Oh, the Pavel Ruins? Humm... Well, go down the paved road in the southern part of town untill you see the "Expedition Party Temporary Headquarters". The Pavel Ruins are east and of there.

By the way, what business do you have in the Pavel Ruins? If you're determined to go there, you should watch out for the *Horrifying Golem Army* and the *Gigantic Chaos Golem*.
