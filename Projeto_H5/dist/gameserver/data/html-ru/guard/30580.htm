!Centurion Parugon:

I, Centurion Parugon, protect the Immortal Plateau and Orc Village. Did you know that in the northern section of the Immortal Plateau, towards the northeast, there are *Frozen Waterfalls.* Is the *Everlasting Winter* coming and freezing everything on the Immortal Plateau to death?
