!Sentinel Eriel:

May the whisper of the wind give your heart peace. I am Sentinel Eriel. I watch the Neutral Zone so that the wicked Dark Elves don t break our peace agreement and invade our forest.

You will enter the Neutral Zone as soon as you cross the bridge. If you go south along the road you will reach *Gludio Castle Town*. It is the closest Human village to the Elven Forest.
