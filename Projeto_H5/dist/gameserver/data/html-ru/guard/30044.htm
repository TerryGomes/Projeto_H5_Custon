!Guard Chiperan:
I used to travel around the kingdom as a mercenary. The reason I came to Talking Island was because I was escorting a ship. But then I fell in love with the beauty of this island and put an end to my vagabond life.

Sunrise on the beach, the thick forest, and the magnificent *waterfalls...* You can t find a more beautiful place in Aden.
