Perhaps you already know this, but Talking Island is where the Elves first taught magic to Humans. The *ruins* in the north used to be a school that the Elves built to teach magic a long time ago.

Now all the Elves have left, although some say that there are a few who have stayed on, but no one knows how old they are.
