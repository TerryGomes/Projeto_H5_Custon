!Guard Glen:

You may not enter the village if you possess contraband or your identification is not in order. I'll need to check your papers and belongings. Thanks for your cooperation.

Is this your first time here? This is a dangerous place for adventurers, my friend! Captain Vishotsky keeps the peace here, but the forest out there is a different matter! All sorts of vicious monsters lurk just outside the walls of this village! Even the mighty Vishotsky cant' kill all of them!
