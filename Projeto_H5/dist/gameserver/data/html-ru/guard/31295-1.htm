!Guard Henrik:

No kidding! I'll tell ya, this place really lives up to its name!

Do you know about the uprising in Rune? They executed the rebels here! This place has been accursed ever since! They say the ghosts here have a taste for flesh!

This is the only way to Rune, but nobody will travel this way after dark! It even creeps me out during the day! I wouldn't go down there at night if I were you!
