Ambassador of Oren:

My master is the ruler of Oren Castle, renowned throughout the world for his wisdom and strength. To you who have gained possession of this fortress, he sends these words: "Prove your loyalty to the castle with this contract!"

Unless you do so, my lord will know that your loyalty is suspect. Make your decision!
