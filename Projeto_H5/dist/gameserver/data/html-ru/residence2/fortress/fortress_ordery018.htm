Uh-huh. I occasionally earn a few Adena as mercenary... A single mission earns me 250,000 Adena. Not a particularly expensive fee, considering that I put my life on the line!

But I get your point. If there is an enemy clan controlling the fortress, I'll escort our mercenary captain there. He can open the central command gate, so be sure to guard him carefully!
