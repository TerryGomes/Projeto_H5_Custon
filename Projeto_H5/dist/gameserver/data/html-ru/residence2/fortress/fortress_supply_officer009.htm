I am checking the supply warehouse.

The current supply level is <font color="LEVEL">Lv %supply_count%</font>. You can receive offers for supplies from the main castle once an alliance is in place, which can be confirmed through the supply level.

Each level is increased every 6 hours while an alliance is in effect, and it can go up by 6 levels. However, please remember that you must offer a tribute of 25,000 Adena before receiving the supplies.
