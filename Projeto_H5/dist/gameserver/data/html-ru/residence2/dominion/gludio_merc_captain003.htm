Mercenary Captain:

Mobility is a basic skill of all mercenaries. What's really needed in a large-scale battle is striders, of course.

A mercenary company receives striders when it signs a contract with a lord. Then we assigne them to individual mercenaries. If you need one, bring enough badges to prove your skill.

During normal Strider I take *50*, for Guardian's Strider - *80*.
