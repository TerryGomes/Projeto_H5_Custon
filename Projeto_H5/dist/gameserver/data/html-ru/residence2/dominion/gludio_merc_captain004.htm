Mercenary Captain:

As the war dragged on, those in power sought for a way to wage the conflict without risking their own positions. Politics, eh? No rich lord wants to weaken the strength of his loyal troops if he doesn't have to.

So hiring mercenaries like us to fight their battles for them became an easy option.

And, I gotta admit, it's a good way for a soldier to make money. Win on the battlefield and you'll earn fame and fortune at the same time.

But remember one thing... You must always fight as well as you can, no matter who has hired you.
