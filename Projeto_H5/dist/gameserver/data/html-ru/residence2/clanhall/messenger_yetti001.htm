Messenger Yeti:

Pettite~ the transparent and energetic building behind me is *Rainbow Spring*. Not my type, but very high class nonetheless. It's a place so nice, it's simply overlooked by ignorant adventurers. The winner gets ultimate bragging rights.

The last winner was *%owner_name%*, challenge him if you think you can defeat a clan!
