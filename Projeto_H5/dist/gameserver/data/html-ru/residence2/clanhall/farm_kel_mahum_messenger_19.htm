Kookaburras... How to describe them...? They're truly magical beasts! They burn their enemy with supernatural powers! What's it called?...  Aura Burn, maybe? Occasionally, they'll peck at their enemy with their beaks! They're strong enough to withstand sword and stick attacks. One drawback, though... they're surprisingly susceptible to magic...
