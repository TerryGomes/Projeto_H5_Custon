Maitre' D Yeti:

You want to know how to use the item you got from me?

Bring some *Hot Spring Nectar* to the Yeti, they'll use it on their jackpot to make it grow faster. Otherwise, *Hot Spring Mineral Water* will aid the growth of your jackpot, but inhibit the growth of the other's.

If you bring *Hot Spring Dragon Water* to the maitre' d, he'll secretly exchange your jackpot with the opposing team's and with *Hot Spring Sulfur*, you can put all the others' arenas on debuff.
