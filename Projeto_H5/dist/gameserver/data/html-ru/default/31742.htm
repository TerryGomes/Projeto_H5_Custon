!Virgil:

Hey, young man! Would you like to hear an old trader's story?

I devoted my entire life to making a profit. Now I'm one of the wealthiest Dwarves ever! My fortune will support my family for generations to come! My wealth is truly great!

But no matter how much money I make, the emptiness I've been feeling has never been filled up! How should I describe it... I feel something lacking, you know?

There's got to be something... something greater and more precious, something noble that will never change even with the passage of time!

I believe I'll find the answer from young people like you!
