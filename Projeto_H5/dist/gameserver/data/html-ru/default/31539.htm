!Flame Blacksmith Vulcan:

My name is Vulcan. I'm a wandering blacksmith, searching the world for stronger, more powerful flames. That's why folks call me the Flame Blacksmith.

I hoped that I could obtain the ultimate flames in this Cauldron of the Gods! I must have them, and I won't leave here until I get them!
