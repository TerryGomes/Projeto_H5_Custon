Deltuva:

Welcome, traveler! I assume that you know the place so must heard about me from someone.

I'm here to help adventurers secretly enter into the Steel Citadel. Even if you are know everything about Steel Citadel, I still can't let you go inside.

It's just too dangerous for the inexperienced. So ... What would you like to do?
