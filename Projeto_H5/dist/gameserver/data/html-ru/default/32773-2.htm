Officer Jakan:

The Bistakon, well, the Bistakon are the one clan in this seed that most resembles the race of man. However, they are a twisted reflection of the most bestial motives and intentions within man's heart. They are wont to acts of extreme violence, tearing their prey limb from limb. There are even reports that they will devour each other when other forms of prey are unavailable.<br>If you are caught in their powerful claws, they will never let go and you may never stop the bleeding. As with the other clans of the Seed, we know nothing about their origins or whether they evolved from some other form. In any case, you must be extremely careful here.
