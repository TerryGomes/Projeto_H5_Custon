Jerian:

Welcome! I've been waiting for a long time for someone to come here. I have to tell you about a strong magical field in the Tower of Infinitum. If someone who does not belong to the demons will enter the tower, magical protection will tear to pieces anyone, but there is a way around this. You have to pretend to be a demon.

If you want to do that, you have to kill the devil and cover your body with his blood ...
