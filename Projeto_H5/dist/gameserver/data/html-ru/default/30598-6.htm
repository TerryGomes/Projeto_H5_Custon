!Several of the villagers here could use you help. Talk to them and click on Quest to see what missions they have to offer. 

Of course, even if they're looking for help tey're not going to offer you a mission that's beyond your capablities. If they refuse to offer you anything, it means you need to get more experience first. Nobody wants you to get into trouble you can't get out of. 

And remember -- some quests can only be compleated once, but others can be done several times.
