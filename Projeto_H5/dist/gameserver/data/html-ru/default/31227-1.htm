*First, you must gather heart pieces.* %%
You can take them from the monsters who lurk on the outskirts of the village. You will find that the pieces are numbered 1-9.%%
Obtain each of the nine differently numbered  pieces in order to qualify to participate in the game,%%
*then you can play rock-paper-scissors*!%%
It's a simple game, where the more you win the more fabulous your prizes become! After each round you may choose whether to continue to the next stage or accept your current prizes and quit. When you lose, the game ends and your prize is reduced. It's always better to quit while you're ahead.
