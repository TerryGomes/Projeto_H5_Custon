You must know which action to use when a Tyrannosaurus tries to cancel a capture skill. When the beast <font color="LEVEL">roars, shakes and writhes</font>, the appropriate capture skills to use are <font color="LEVEL">kabokula, tapirawa and shabonoba</font>. Watch each action of the Tyrannosaurus carefuly and respond with the correct skill.

Remember that using a capture skill consumes both capture stones and MP be sure to prepare enuogh of them both! May Shilen bless your efforts!
