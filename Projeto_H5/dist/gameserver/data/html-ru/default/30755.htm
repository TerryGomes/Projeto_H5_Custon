!Earthdragon Watcher Theodric:
I am earthdragon watcher Theodric.

My divine mission is to watch every movement of Antharas, the accursed creature of the goddess Shilen, so that it will not be awakened from the deep sleep that binds him.  In order to fulfill this divine mission, I gave up my soul to the darkness, and became an immortal undead.

Although you may go into the cave, you will not be able to reach the Lair of Antharas.  This is because the gateway to enter the lair has been firmly sealed by the seal watchers.  In order to enter the lair, you have to use a *portal stone* to activate the *core of the magic force field*...
