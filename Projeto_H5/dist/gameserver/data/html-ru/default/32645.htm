!Officer Carrier Chandra:

Alright! I can easily manage 200 boxes an hour! How about 300? Nothing gets the blood pumping like the prospect of breaking your own record!

Huh? Were you there all along? Well, you've got a front row seat, my friend. I'm the new *Carrier* here. Our volume has really picked up, so the guild decided to expand the operation. You don't know what a Carrier does? In the simplest terms, it's a person who sends freight here and there. Of course, in reality it's not nearly as simple as it sounds!

And there are complications. Sometimes other things get mixed in, things like *rats*...
