I have no information about the origins of this species, but what I have found is that these creatures do possess a unique energy, sort of plasma if you will. Hmm… <font color="LEVEL">Maguen Plasma</font>. I like that. I think that is what I’ll call it. Anyway, when a Maguen appears it begins to bring forth one of these plasmas. It will also cycle through its various plasmas before hiding.

With Blacksmith Kusto’s talent and my magic we were able to create a device that could harvest these plasmas… a <font color="LEVEL">Maguen Plasma Collector</font>. I know it isn’t too creative but we decided to keep the name simple to avoid explaining what it does. 

Ugh… fine. I’ll explain it to you. When you are in the Seed and a Maguen appears you have a very limited time to collect the Maguen Plasma. If you don’t collect the plasma in time the Maguen will go back into hiding. I’ve set up a practice Maguen if you want to try using the Maguen Plasma Collector.

This isn’t a real Maguen, so you won’t collect any Plasma… just thought you should know so you don’t get your hopes up.
