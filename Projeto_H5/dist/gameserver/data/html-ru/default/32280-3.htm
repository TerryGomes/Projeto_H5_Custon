Oracle Guide:

Light shimmering into five colors and slows its movement inside the ball, and his voice sound deafly and indifferent:
It is very difficult to talk about my home, which is now under the control of demons. But my duty - to answer your questions ...
When you go through the first door, you have to choose between the Emerald area and Dungeons of Eva.
 <font color="LEVEL">Emerald Square</font> was a beautiful place, located in the depths of the ocean, and now it's just a playground of Crystal Golems.

<font color="LEVEL">Dungeon of Eva</font> - a narrow corridor over an underwater volcano, he's just crawling with demons!
<font color="LEVEL">Crystal Garden</font>, which can be reached by going through the second door, was a wonderful palace, but now mad spirits of waters roam in his rooms.

You need to free these three seats from demons to save Parme. If you don't have any strategy, I suggest you go through the first gate and choose between two paths.
