!Newbie Guide:

As token of congratulations, the Adventure Guild is pleased to open its warehouse to both apprentice adventurers who have reached level
 6 as well as travellers who have completed their first occupation change. At level 6, you can borrow a *No-Grade Shadow Weapon*
 with the *Apprentice Adventurer's Weapon Exchange Coupon*. At level 20, you can borrow *Shadow Armor* with the *Adventurer's Magic Armor Exchange Coupon*.
 No-Grade Shadow Weapons can be exchanged up to level 19 and Shadow Armor can be exchanged up to level 39. Now then: how can I help you?

(Note: chaotic characters may not use weapons or armor borrowed from Adventure Guild.)
