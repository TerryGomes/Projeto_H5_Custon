!Master Kaspar:
Do you mean Icarus? All the students, including me, feared him. Perhaps it's because he's an undead or something but he neither eats nor sleeps. But the magic that he holds -- in particular, his knowledge about necromancy -- is clearly the greatest in the land.

He appears to be going around freely but it is said that he is actually being invisibly constrained by Master Hardin. Therefore, he still teaches various things to us in a friendly way...

But, well, this is just my feeling about the matter... Even if he wasn't restrained, I am sure he would continue to teach us for the time being. It's not that he, who is an undead, feels the any particular love... It's for another reason...
