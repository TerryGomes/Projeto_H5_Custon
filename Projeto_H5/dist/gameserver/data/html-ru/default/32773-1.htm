Officer Jakan:

Ugh, where should I begin? There's a lot to say about this place, none of it good. But if you want to survive here, you'd do well to listen. The Seed of Annihilation is crawling with psychotic monsters unlike anything you've seen before. There are three clans... or races really, I can't tell that they have any social structure.

We call them the *Bistakon, Cokrakon, and Reptilikon*. They are quite distint from one another, but the one thing that unites them is a thirst for violence and death. Which do you want to learn about?
