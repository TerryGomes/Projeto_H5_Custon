Reputation Manager Scipio:

Fame comes naturally when one takes an active part in battles with others. If you have clan members with the same goal, consider participating in Castle Sieges, Fortress Battles and Clan Hall Battles. If you have party members who work extremely well together, try your luck in the Underground Coliseum Game or the Festival of Darkness. If you are alone, demonstrate your prowess by participating in the Olympiad.

You can use Clan Reputation Points earned in any of the above games to help increase your clan's fame or improve your own PVP capabilities.
