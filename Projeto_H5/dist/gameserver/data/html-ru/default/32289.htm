!Symbol of Adversity:

I knew you would succeed!

However, there are still two tests left, so be alert they will be more challenging than the tests you have already passed.

But first I shall grant you a reward. You have proven your trustworthiness, and its a show of gratitude on behalf of those you have helped, I give you this advice.

Go to the Island of Paryer and find a man named *Ringos*. Accept his offer, though it may seem strange, and you shall earn a secret key that will prove essential at the Emerald Square.
