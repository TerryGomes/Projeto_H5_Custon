!Hunter Union Member Colin:

The Hunter Union is just a union of Hunters. But we are different from the ignoramus who the nobles' call 'Hunters'. We are professionals, we continuously train our skills... You will know the details soon...

The Hunter Union also has a some of the characteristics of an autonomy. Even though Castle Aden has dispatched Guards, we are able to defend ourselves with our own strength. Not only do we know this, but the Guards also approve. However, our town stubbornly wants the Guards to stay here...

It is a bit of a complicated story...
