Pumpkins grow by drinking pumpkin nectar! After planting a seed, if you pour the nectar on the pumpkin, it will grow quickly! Meow! 

After drinking enough nectar, the pumpkin will become big. Then, if you hit it with a weapon, the pumpkin will crack open!

But, there are several things you should be careful about!

*First of all, if you hit it before it's fully grown*, it will wilt from lack of nutrition. So be careful. Meow!

Also, since *a pumpkin has a tendency to run away*, you should try to crack it open before it gets out of hand!  Young pumpkins that are not fully grown will run off in 3 minutes and fully grown pumpkins will run away in a minute and 30 seconds! Meow!

*Also, a large pumpkin can't be opened with a regular weapon!* Meow! I heard that there is a *weapon called chrono something* that produces musical sounds when you hit it against something. Only when you use that, you will be able to crack open your pumpkin!

*One last thing! Since it's not easy to open a large pumpkin by yourself*, you should find a friend who can help you open it.

Do you understand everything I've told you? Meow!
