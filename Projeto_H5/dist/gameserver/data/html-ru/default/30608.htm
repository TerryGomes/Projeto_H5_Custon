!Maria:

Hello, stranger? Did you know? Dion used to be called as the most beautiful territory. However, now it is a physically, and spiritually unclean land.

To those who have extrasensory perception, the cries of the spirits can be heard even at this very moment. It is because those who have died unjustly couldn't find peace and rest so that they still dwell in this land. Can the voices be heard to you, also?
