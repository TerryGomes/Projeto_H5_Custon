!Vice Hierarch Casca:

To become a Dragoon, you must gain the approval of someone with authority.

I believe Master Gwain currently has that role. You may be able to find him in the Town of Gludio.

Return here with a recommendation letter from him and the requisite skills, and you will become a Dragoon.
