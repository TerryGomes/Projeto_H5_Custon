!Zerstorer Marcela:

Long ago, the Kamael were called Marksmen, and their commanders were called Zerstorers.

Ah, but that was when all Kamael were warriors. Now, of course, we have a village, and there are civilians among us. So gradually the Marksmen became the keepers of law, and the Zerstorers became the keepers of justice.
