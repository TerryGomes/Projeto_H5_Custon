Officer Jakan:

The Reptilikons were the most familiar to us when we crashed here because they superficially resemble the Lizardmen clans. However, as I said, the resemblence is purely superficial. They don't seem to have any advanced social structure beyond the tendency to travel in herds and devour everything in sight. Just about every Reptilikon possesses a deadly poisonous bite.<br>Of the clans of Seed beasts, they seem to be the most prolific. In any case, if you value your life, be careful here.
