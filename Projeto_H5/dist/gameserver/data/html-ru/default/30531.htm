!First Elder Lockirin:

Welcome, young friend, to the House of Elders. My name is Lockirin Stonecutter. I am the eldest Master of the *Iron Gate Guild* and also the First Elder of the *Association of Guild Elders* . These titles sound fine enough, but really my job is to keep these headstrong old chaps in line.
