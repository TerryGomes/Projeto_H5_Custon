If you need something, please let me know.

Weapons and armor can be enhanced *beyond Grade A* for *top-grade items* and specialized for PvP. Weapons must have *bestowed special abilities*... Once it is enhanced, an item *can only be used by its owner*.

And once a multi-user item is specialized, *you can use enhanced Spellbooks, but you cannot refine, soul crystalize or convert it*. Be careful so that you don't have to cancel the effect.
