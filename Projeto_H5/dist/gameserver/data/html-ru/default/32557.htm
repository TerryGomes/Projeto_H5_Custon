!Engineer Lekon:

I'm too busy to take a breath! I'm supposed to maintain all these Airships and air vehicles by myself?! How does that make sense?

And it's all very detailed, time-consuming work with no margin for error. Somebody up there must really hate me!

Well, at least they supply me with the materials I need. Hey, adventurer! You must know how to use Airships or air vehicles. Care to lend me a hand?
