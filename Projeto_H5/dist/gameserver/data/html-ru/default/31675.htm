This place has been the boundary between the two kingdoms for hundreds of years. I trust that you will behave yourself among the foreigners and do nothing to bring discredit, dishonor or even embarrassment upon Aden Kingdom.

Should you meet "Yeus" on the other side, I'd be obliged if you would give him greetings from me. I know that would make him very happy...
