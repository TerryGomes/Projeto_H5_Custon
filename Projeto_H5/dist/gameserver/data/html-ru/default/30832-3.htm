!Hardin:
Beleth was a mage that graduated from the Ivory Tower during the Elmoreden era but had magical powers so strong that you almost couldn't say he was destined to die. Because he used those magical powers just to satisfy his own greed, he came to be called a demon later...

But why are you asking me about him...? I don't know any more than anyone else.

Or, are you curious about whether there was a relationship between Beleth and me...?
