Nemo:

Who are you? What business do you have with the Great Magician of Oren? Speak! Hmm... not a chatty one, are you? Well if you must know, I am here on important business.

It is said that a mysterious creature can only be found on this Seed. Have you heard of a *Maguen*? Yes, I know it is a silly name. But aren't you the least bit intrigued?
