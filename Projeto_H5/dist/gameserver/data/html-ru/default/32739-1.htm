Bomona:

How do you feel? You should give yourself a minute to adjust.

You now have 2 special skills. If you use Treykan Claw, Torumba won't care if you are man or beast. The jig will be up and you'll have to fight for your life.

If things get out of control, use your Treykan Dash skill to increase your speed.

I'll let you figure out the rest. May your god smile upon you.
