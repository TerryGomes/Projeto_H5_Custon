!Aquilani:

Be cautious of your every thought here. Those who desecrate these sacred grounds never forget.. ever. And when you leave this place, don't ever reflect back on it. Some things are best forgotten. 

Our brothers and sisters find a comfort here that the rest of the world would deny them. Remember that.
