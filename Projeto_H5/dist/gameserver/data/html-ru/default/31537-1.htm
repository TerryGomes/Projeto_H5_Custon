Beast Herder Tunatun:

You...? You don't look that strong. Raising beasts is not an easy thing.

It could be really dangerious if something goes wrong. It's OK when they are young, but it becomes too dangerous for you to handle when they're are fully grown up.

Maybe it would be better for you to come back again when you become a little more stronger. Then, I will gladly give you this Beast Handler's Whip.
