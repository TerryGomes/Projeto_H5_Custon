!Gatekeeper Lamcedas:

This is the pier for Gludio Airships. Airships headed for the continent of Gracia also arrive and depart from here.

We tap into a strong aura of power and depend on favorable winds to allow the Airships to travel such a far distance.

if you're not ready to leave for Gracia yet, you'd best go back.
