!Magister Papiku:

Bam ba bam ba bah! I'm the singing magister, Papiku!

Why am I in a good mood? Well, the passage to Gracia -- which had been blocked for hundreds of years -- has finally been opened!

That's good, since the Gracian people desperately need our help. And we can have the use of the fabled *ship that sails on a sea of stars*, which we believed had been lost forever. Imagine how much our understanding of magic will benefit from this!
