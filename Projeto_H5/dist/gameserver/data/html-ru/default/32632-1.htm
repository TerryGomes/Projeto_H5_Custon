!Gracian Survivor:

There is a place at the western end of the Aden, on the shores of the Sea of Gludio, where airships depart for Gracia. It's a wharf created though ancient Giant technology and the best Aden engineers.

Since it floats in the mid-air, however, there's no way to go there directly. The only way is to teleport there directly. A gatekeeper from Talking Island or Gludio Castle village can send you there.

We are desperate for help. If you are willing, I can send you up to Gludio Airship Wharf by myself.

But because some items are consumed, I must charge you something. I feel almost ashamed to ask.

I only hope you will see it as a donation to Gracia. If you can't afford it, the Gatekeeper in Gludio Catle Village or Talking Island can also send you there. What would you like to do?
