!Naff:

Have you heard about the beast that lurks in the hot springs area?

Icicle Emperor Bumbalump, also known as the king of the yetis!

It's said that he eats people alive!

How gruesome.

He's a voracious eater, and can put away a family in one sitting!

I don't know why nobody has killed him yet!
