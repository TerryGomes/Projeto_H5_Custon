Information Broker Mist:

Who do you think you are? Can't you see I'm spending quality time with my granddaughter?

You just couldn't resist, eh?

Hmm... You've got a good eye!

She's very pretty, isn't she?! Her name's Lilly.

Her parents died when she was quite young! I've raised her as my own...

She's such a treaure to me. She's the apple of my eye!
