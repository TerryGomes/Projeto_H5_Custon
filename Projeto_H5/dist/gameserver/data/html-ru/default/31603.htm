!Black Cat:

Hi, kiddo!

Ha! Does my calling you "kiddo" offend you?

Well, Tve lived for hundreds of years, so everyone is a kid to me!

Heed my words, my young friend! I've never allowed anything to stand between me and my goals, not even decency!

But recently, my past evil deeds have begun to haunt my dreams... I've begun to question my mercenary existence...

What if I had lived an ordinary life?

Maybe ... just old and sentimental, eh?

....

Well, there* s no use crying over spilt milk.

I have no choice now but to continue climbing until I fall.
