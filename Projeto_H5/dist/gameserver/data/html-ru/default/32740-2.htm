Gatekeeper Batracos:

You look too inexperienced to make a journey to see Tanta Seer Ugoros. If you can convince Chief Investigator Johnny that you should go, then I will let you pass. Johnny has been everywhere and done everything. He may not be of my people but he has my respect, and anyone who has his will in turn have mine as well.
