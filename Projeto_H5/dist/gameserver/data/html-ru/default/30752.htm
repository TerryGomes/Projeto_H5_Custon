!Wyrm Shamhai:

Why are you looking for me? Do you wish to kill me too? Unlike the other wyverns down there, I have no intention of attacking you... Do you still want to kill me?  Someone has stolen my eggs and the eggs of my fellow wyverns. We have searched every corner of the continent for them...
