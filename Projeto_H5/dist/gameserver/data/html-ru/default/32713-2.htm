!Pathfinder Worker

Daytime Zaken is another aspect of Zaken.

Unlike his nighttime counterpart, he hides himself because he knows he is weak...

But there is a way to find him. Light a <font color="LEVEL">candle on a barrel</font> and it will show you the way.

But be careful! The candlelight may also alert his subordinates to your location.

Compared to Nighttime Zaken, Daytime Zaken is not that strong -- you should be able to attack him with a combined force of <font color="LEVEL">1 to 3 parties</font>
