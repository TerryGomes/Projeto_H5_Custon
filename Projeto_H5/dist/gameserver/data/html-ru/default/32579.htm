!Darkness of Dawn:

You hear what seems to be a human voice emanate from the shining blue sphere.

"I am the Darkness of Dawn -- the hidden exit of the Order of Dawn. 

To access my functions, you must confirm your identity.

If you have already received the permission of Order of the Dawn, you will be able to pass through... Do you wish to gain access now?
