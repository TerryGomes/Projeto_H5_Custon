Ketra's Messenger Wahkan:

We Ketra are the bravest of all Orc tribes! We're here to reclaim the land of our ancestors! Prepare to die, all who stand in our way!

Don't take us for fools! We're well aware of the fact that in order to defeat the enemy, we must ally with outside forces! Like you! Will you be our comrade in arms? Are you ready to prove your worth alongside us on the battlefield?
