This is the way to the Ice Queen's Throne room, where she awaits. As I've told you, Freya is powerful beyond all comprehension and can destroy you with a mere thought. I keep telling other would-be heroes this, but they keep going anyway. It's actually getting rather fun. But I'm SURE you're different than they were! You shall succeed where they failed. Hahahaha...
