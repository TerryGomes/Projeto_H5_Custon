!Master Kaspar:
This place, Hardin's Academy, welcomes you. I, Kaspar, am one of the students of Master Hardin and am in charge of managing the academy.

You can stay here as long as you want. But we don't permit any interference in the experiments of Hardin's students or in other activities. However, if you want to cooperate, we will be glad to welcome you. That's because we need help from everyone.

There's not much we can give in payment but you'll still be able to get some teaching from us.
