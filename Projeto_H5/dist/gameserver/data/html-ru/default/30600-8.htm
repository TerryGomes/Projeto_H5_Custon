!I am pleased to tell you what I know, but I do not know everything. You should speak to as many of the villagers as you can. 

Have you already spoken to *Abyssal Celebrant*  *Undrias* at teh gate of the Temple of Shilen? He may want to ask a favor of you. 

Also, seek out *Sentry Nelsya* at the north entrance of the village. 'Tis the season of Shilen's Hunting Ceremony, and they are looking for volunteers. 

Let's see ... ah, yes! See that you speak to *Collette* and to Trader Payne as well
