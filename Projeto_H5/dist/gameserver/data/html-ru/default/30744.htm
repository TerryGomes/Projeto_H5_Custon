!Hunter Guild Member Grey:
It would be wrong to think of the Hunter Guild as a group where members take bows and chase after rabbits and deer. Our guild is made up of those that hunt for the highest level rewards, assassins of evil beings and explorers of ruins. The guild members are specialists in searching, tracking and hunting and they never fail to achieve what they set their sights on. They are all experienced hunters. Of course, depending on the situation, they have the fighting ability to be able to cut short the lives of their targets. Ah, I was so busy introducing the guild that I forgot to greet you. I am Hunter Guild Member Grey.
