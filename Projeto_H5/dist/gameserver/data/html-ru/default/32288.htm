!Symbol of Faith:

You have proven your trustworthiness...

I have a secret to tell you about the demons.

You may find *Water Dragon Scales* in the Chromatic Highlands. This is a symbol that signified those who long ago followed the Water Dragon, Fafurion. It is an excellent cure for those who have been driven insane by the demons.
