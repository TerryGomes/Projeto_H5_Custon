!Soldier Moira:

Hmm. What business do you have here? If you're asking about the current status, I haven't seen any sign of the enemy around here.

I just don't know how much longer we have to stand guard. I signed on to fight the enemy, not to play sentry while those adventurers from Aden get all the glory...

Bah! Forget what I said. I don't want to pick a fight with you. We're all thankful for your help. Because of your arrival, some of our soldiers can finally get some much-needed R-and-R.
