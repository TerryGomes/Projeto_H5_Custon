!Vice Hierarch Zenya:

Vice Hierarch Casca can tell you about the skills available to male Kamael â€” I can tell you of the Arbalesters, those skilled female Kamael who make up the secret Steelrazor force,

Strictly speaking, not all Arbalesters belong to the Steelrazor, just as not all Human Knights belong to a guild.

Arbalesters learn to mislead and deceive their enemies through their stealth and skill at trapping. Their weapon of choice is the Bow.
