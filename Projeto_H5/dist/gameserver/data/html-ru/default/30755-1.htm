!Earthdragon Watcher Theodric:
The portal stone is the key that you need to use in order to enter the Lair of Antharas.  It is given only to those who are selected by *seal watchers* as slayers of Antharas.  If you are truly wanting to confront Antharas, go see *Gabrielle* who is the leader of the seal watchers and receive an approval to be a slayer of Antharas.  Then, I, the earthdragon watcher Theodric will present to you a portal stone.
