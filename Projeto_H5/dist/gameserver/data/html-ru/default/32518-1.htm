!Vortex Gate:

It is Aerial Cleft before you and you can feel strange energy emanating from this place. 

The Cleft... It's a battleplace, the source of storm energy. You can participate the battle. In this case you will need to choose one of two teams. The battle will begin when each group will consist in 9 members.

To participate you should be able to transform into the *flying form*. Points are given for killing the opposite team members and destroying the Emerers. Also you can get additional bonus if you'll wisely distribute the energy which is given to one team member.

As the reward you can receive Diamond Shard and Starstone.
