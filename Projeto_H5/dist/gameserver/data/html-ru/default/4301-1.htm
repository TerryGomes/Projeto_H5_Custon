!Queen of Hearts:

Meow~ You're really a lovable person.<br>
I'll definitely help you show your heart to the one who's precious to you.<br>
If you use the <font color="LEVEL">Valentine Secret Spell</font> that I gave you, you can find out the <font color="LEVEL">way to make a special Valentine Cake</font> for the person you love~ meow~.<br>
If you register the Valentine Secret Spell as a recipe, then collect 10 dark chocolates, 10 white chocolates, and 5 fresh creams, you can make a cake. It can fail sometimes, so pray for success in your heart~ meow~~<br>
But, I can't give you the chocolates and fresh cream. Some unknown monsters took them after raiding the warehouse awhile ago.<br>
But with the courage that comes from making a gift for someone precious to you, you should be able to retrieve the cake ingredients from the monsters.<br>
