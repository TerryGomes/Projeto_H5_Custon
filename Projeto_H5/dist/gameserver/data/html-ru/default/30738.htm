!Alchemist Matild:

Don't you think it's pure prejudice to say that Dwarves can't use magic? I have been interested in alchemy ever since I was young and even went for study at the Ivory Tower. And I left school because of an unavoidable situation... No, I had to quit in the middle of my studies but still I studied really hard while I was there.
