!Summoner Basillia

Greetings, traveler. I am Basillia, a Summoner in the Ivory Tower. Good to see you.

This area is where I was born... I've been gone for thirty years and everything looks very different now. All that is here now are the scars left by the war with Gracia... The beautiful town of my childhood is all gone...
