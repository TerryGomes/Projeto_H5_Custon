!Arujien:

Sometimes I wonder if we've forgotten the truly important things in life. I once was a student studying magic. There was a time when I spent all my energy on research and discipline--hungry to put my hands on the greatest magical powers.

But at this instant, as I feel the cool wind blowing through the trees and picture *the woman I love*, I cannot help but just smile. This small, but strong happiness has become the most precious thing in my life.

How about you? Do you have also something as precious?
