Nice to meet you, young traveler. This edifice is the *Obelisk of Victory.* I don't know if you are interested in history, but there are many historic relics of ancient Talking Island in this area. This tower here was built a thousand years ago and to the west you can find the ancient *Elven Ruins.*
