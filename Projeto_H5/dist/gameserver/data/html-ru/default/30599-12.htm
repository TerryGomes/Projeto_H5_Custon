!Newbie Guide:

*A novice character* is one who is new to the world of Lineage II. Certain benefits are available to novice characters up to level 62.

Taxes and other charges have led to a steep increase inprices for armor and weaponry. To help offset this problem, *novice characters can exchange their used gearfor full credit towards the purchase of new equipment* in any weapon or armor shop.%%
Also, the threat of monsters may be overwhelming for novice characters. I help them as much as possible..

*Come and see me for support magic that is appropriatefor your level.*%%
This will help build the confidence you'll need to challengethe powerful monsters in this world.

Thirdly, *Soulshots and Spiritshot for Novices will be given in addition.*%%
A novice character can receive additional Soulshots and Spiritshot for novices if he completes a particular quest. The information for this quest will be provided later.

And lastly, occasionally players find that they wish to change the race or class of their character. *Novice character benefits may be passed to a new character upto level 6.* However, once a character reaches level 6, then only that character receives benefits as a novice.
