!Rizraell:

Next to the Elven Forest is the region of Oren where Humans live. There is also the *Sea of Spores*. However, there is a mountain range between the Elven Forest and Oren, so we can't pass freely.

The place called the Sea of Spores was once a battlefield of the great war between Elves and Men. Before that, it was a beautiful place, but the battle magic of the war polluted the ground, and the blight grows wider even to this very day. They say the Mystics at the *Ivory Tower* have set up force fields that are just barely sufficient to contain the blight. In the fight between us Elves and the Humans, nature was the ultimate loser.
