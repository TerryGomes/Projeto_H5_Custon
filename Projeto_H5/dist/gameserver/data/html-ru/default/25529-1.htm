!Garden Guard:

First, only Kamael and their party members may enter.

Secondly, you must be accompanied by at least one other companion.

Thirdly, you must be neither too experienced nor too inexperienced to face this challenge.

Finally, all Kamael who wish to take this test must first earn permission from the Heirarch.

Now, do you meet these requirements?

(To face this challenge, you must be in a party with a Kamael on the "Into the Large Cavern" quest, and each member of the party must be between levels 15-22 without having completed their first class transfer.)
