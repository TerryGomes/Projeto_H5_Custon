!Gantaki Zu Urutu:

Hear, young Orc!! Let me explain the origin of our race! In the beginning, there was Paagrio of the flame, and from the hot flame Paagrio brought forth the the father of the Orcs. His hair was a red blaze, his eyes a pure white flame, ashen smoke rushed out of his nose and mouth as he breathed, and in his veins boiled blood hotter than lava! Because of all this, he was mightier than any other living thing!

But when he came down from the heavens, the heat of his body began to cool, because of the force of the water. His lava blood began to harden, because of the force of the earth. His smoke was scattered, because of the force of the wind. The father of the Orcs was miserable because he had lost his original strength, but the god Paagrio taught him that if he continuously trained his body through discipline and combat, he could become strong again. From then on, his descendants have been pursuing strength and power and the glory of our bloody history begins!
