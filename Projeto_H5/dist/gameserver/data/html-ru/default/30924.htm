!Wharf Manager Nedy:

Innandril come through many bloody wars relatively unscathed. Lionel Hunter was a very good leader, skilled in both diplomatic and military matters. Under his rule Innandril's wealth began to rival that of Giran. But that was then and this is now. Chaos swirls around us and no one knows where we will end up!

Anyway, what do I know? I'm just an old wharf rat. By the way, would you like to buy a ticket for the ferry?
