!Oracle Guide:

A mysterious five-colored whirlwind swirls within an aquamarine sphere, and you hear a clear, cultured voice.

Welcome. I am the first child of the Oracle. My mistress ia *Parme*, the Shamaness of the Water Dragon. She is currently under the enemy's control, but an Oracle led me to this place just before she was captured.<br1>
My mission is to safely escort you to her current location.

Unfortunately, that place is unreachable without proper preparation.

If you are ready, please give me your hand, and I shall open the way.
