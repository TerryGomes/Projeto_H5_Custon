!Vice Hierarch Zenya:

I am Vice Hierarch Zenya. I assist the Hierarch and watch over you, our young Kamael warriors, who are leaving the safety of our little nest.

Now that the seal on the Kamael has been broken and other races come in and out of the village as they please, I am concerned that the Kamael who leave this place will forget our ancient traditions and customs. Certainly they are very different from those of the outside world...

Do not forget! Cling tightly to the skills, the culture and the spirit of the Kamael.
