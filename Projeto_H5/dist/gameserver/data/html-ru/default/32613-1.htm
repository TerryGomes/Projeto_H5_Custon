Game Manager Handy:

Handy's block checker is a game where the team *who checks the most blocks in the arena within the 5-minute time limit wins.*

When you enter the game, you automatically change into the *Block Checker*'s shape! If you hit the blocks with the block checker's hammer...

Boom! The blocks' colors change! The team with the most checked blocks -- blocks whose color has been changed -- wins!

*When the game begins, all current supplemental magic will be automatically removed! No new supplement magic can be cast, even if the game ends.*
