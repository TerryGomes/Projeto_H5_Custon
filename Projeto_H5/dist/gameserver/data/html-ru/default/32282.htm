Yikes! That was a surprise.

...

I'm sorry. I didn't mean to act so shocked â€” it's just so unusual to see people in this area...

My name is Yiyen, and I'm an archeologist searching for a magical ruin that may be responsible for some strange phenomena on the Isle of Prayer. Thank the gods, I think I've finally found it.

It is called the *Dark Cloud Mansion*, if I have translated the name correctly...
