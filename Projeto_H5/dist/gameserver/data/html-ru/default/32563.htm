!Soldier Plenos:

Welcome to Keucereus Alliance Base. We need all the soldiers we can get.

Your missions here will be mainly in the sky. My advice is to obtain an Airship, but I see some adventurers from Aden also fight using their ability of transformation.

Go ask Engineer Lekon about which method is best for you. If you want to know about our enemy, talk to Admiral Keucereus or General Dilios.
