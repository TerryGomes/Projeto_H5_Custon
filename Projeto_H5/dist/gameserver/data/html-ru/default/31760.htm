!Adventurers' Guide Miss Queen:

Welcome! I've been dispatched from the Adventurer's Guild to guide characters new to the world of Lineage II.

In celebration of the arrival of a new era, the guild has temporarily opened its weapons warehouse to adventurers in training and travelers that have reached level 6 and completed their first occupation change. If you meet these requirements, I'll give you a <font color="LEVEL">weapon exchange coupon</font> and permit you to <font color="LEVEL">rent the weapon of your choice from the Adventurer's Guild weapons warehouse</font>. Bear in mind, this coupon is only valid until you reach level 25. Are you ready to choose your weapon?

(Any character with a PK count of 1 or above is not eligible to receive the coupon.)

[npc_%objectId%_Quest|- Yes, I Want this weapon.]
