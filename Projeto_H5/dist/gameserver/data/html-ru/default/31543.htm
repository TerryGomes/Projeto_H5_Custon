Pulin:

This hot springs resort came highly recommended...

But it seems very dangerous, doesn't it!?

There must be thousands of monsters skulking about! I'm scared to go outside at all! I was nearly killed on my way here!

But, I suppose there's always a bright side! The waters of this hot spring are incredibly rejuvenating!

My fatigue just melts away!
