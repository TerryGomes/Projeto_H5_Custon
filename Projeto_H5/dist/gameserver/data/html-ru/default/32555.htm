!Soldier Tenis:

Huh! What, are you laughing at me? I can barely stand, and you think it's funny?

But this isn't the end. I'm just conserving my strength so I'll be ready to fight...

Trust me, when the time comes I'll fight for my lord and for the future of Gracia. I don't care if the enemy is the power of darkness, that fool Karneia or greedy adventurers from far-off lands!
