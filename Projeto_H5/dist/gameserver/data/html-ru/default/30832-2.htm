!Hardin:
There are a lot of people with prejudices about necromancers. However, necromancy magic, which is performed by necromancers -- is divided into the lines of healing magic and resurrection magic depending on the person. This is a field of study with a deep history that has been passed down since the titan era. In short, a necromancer is a person that studies the lives of humans and other living beings.

Humans are instinctively afraid of blood. And that seems to be the reason that necromancers are misunderstood in a variety of ways.

If you are interested in necromancers or necromancy, you may be able to find the way to it here. At least, I hope so.
