!Soldier Siest:

You can use an Airship to take you to different locations in Gracia. Board one in the wharf behind us by using the Airship Controller.

If there is no Airship currently docked there, you'll just have to wait. Unless, of course, you're one of those Aden adventurers who can transform into a flying creature...
