!Heart of Volcano:

A voice overpowers your consciousness, you fall to your knees clutching your head in agony :

<font color="LEVEL">A creature born in the chaos of Creation%%
trapped for an eternity on earth%%
driven to madness%%
forsaken by her children.%%
You, Dark Pilgrim of the Holy Land,%%
Do you seek death at the jaws of the Fire Dragon Valakas?</font>

(A maximum of 200 people can challenge Valakas.)
