Investigator Sally:

Most of the Leto Lizardmen died from the poisons of the plants found on the plains, but those who didn't seem to have evolved into a new race called the Tanta Lizardmen. However, I believe there are some Leto that are still living in an area outside the Plains of the Lizardmen, avoiding the poisons and maintaining their original appearance.

I think they live in the shadow of a hill *northeast of the Plains, near the road leading to the Hunter's Village.*

In fact, I'm sure of it! I saw them myself.
