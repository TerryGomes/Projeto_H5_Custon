!Gracian Survivor:

I understand your dissatisfaction, but Gracia is't an easy place. I'm sorry, but you have not enough abilities to get into Gracia. You'll become an easy target for our enemies.

There are many monsters in Aden too. First you must get the experience there, and then go into Gracia.

(Only characters above level 75 can get into Gracia.)
