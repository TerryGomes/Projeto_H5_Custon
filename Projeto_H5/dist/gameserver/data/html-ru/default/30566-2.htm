!Atuba Chief Varkees:

Tejakar Oroka! The Orcs have thousands of tribes! However, only seven tribes carry on the noble blood! I am going to sing their names, so listen well!

The brave Hestui!

The cold-hearted Atuba!

The persistent Neruga!

The strong-willed Urutu, the resourceful Duda-Mara!

And the merciless Gandi!

One more thing! There are tribes of traitors that betrayed their own kind! Their names are forgotten!
