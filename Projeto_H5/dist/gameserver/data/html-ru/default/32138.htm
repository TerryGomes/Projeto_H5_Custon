!Hierarch Kekropus:

May the grace of the great ones be with you...

I am Kekropus, the Head Elder of the Kamael. I am the oldest living Kamael, experienced beyond your ken.

Until recentely, we Kamael were hidden from the wider world, sealed between dimensions for ages. Now that we have emerged, the power we wield will change the world in ways it does not even fully realize...
