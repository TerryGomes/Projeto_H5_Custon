!Sir Eric Rodemai:

Welcome to Aden Castle Town.  I am Eric Rodemai, one of the court guards.  Oren is the center of military affairs and Giran is the center of commerce&   And here, Aden is considered the center of politics, culture and religion.

Hearing this, you may think that the place has the bustling atmosphere of a metropolitan area.  But due to its proximity to the border with Elmore, it always tends to maintain a somewhat tense atmosphere.  The two types of atmosphere are always co-mingling creating a unique balance.
