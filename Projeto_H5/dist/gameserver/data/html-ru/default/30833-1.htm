!Master Kaspar:
This is basically the place for carrying out the research activities of Master Hardin and us students of his. The Master hates the dogmatism and elitist education of the Ivory Tower and so he left there to establish this academy privately. And he accepts students like me of ordinary birth that don't have remarkable talent at magic...

However, I still wonder if there might have been a reason that he left the Ivory Tower other than the one that he has told us students. Well... For example, perhaps he is developing a force to go up against the Ivory Tower...
