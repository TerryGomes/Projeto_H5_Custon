!Earthdragon Watcher Gilmore:
I am earthdragon watcher Gilmore
Antharas is one of the six dragons of ancient times.  It is the most dreadful evil beast that has ever come from the spawn of Shilen.  My divine calling is to watch his every movement even listening for his heartbeat and breathing to make sure that he is not awakened from the fetters of his deep sleep.  In order to fulfill this important task, I was willing to give up my mortal life to obtain a body that never dies

Is it truly your desire to confront the earthdragon Antharas face to face?  Antharas is currently locked in a cave without any outlet.  You can go in there only by going through the *core of a magic force field*...
