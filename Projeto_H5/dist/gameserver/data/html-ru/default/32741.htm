Researcher Ankumi:

Hey there, have you come to experience the Plains of the Lizardmen? There's no place like it in the world! Especially to a very skilled researcher like me. Unfortunately, I study more than I swordfight, so I never stray from the investigators.

Never hurts to have some muscle, right? You look like a tough one.
