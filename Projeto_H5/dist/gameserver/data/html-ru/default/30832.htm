!Harin:
Nice to meet you. I am a mage called Hardin. People say a lot of things about me but what do you think after seeing me directly? I'm different than ordinary mages, no?

I'm a graduate of the Ivory Tower but I had some doubts about the elitism there. Well... It may have just been foolishness during my younger days, but... Anyway, I did a lot of thinking at that time...

So, let me know if you're curious about anything. This academy is open to everyone. However, please understand that instruction in magic is given only to my pupils...
