!Hunters Guild Member Tor:
Just because my profession is a hunter, don t think that all I do is go after deer or wolves all day!  My enterprise encompasses the hunting of evil creatures for prize money to the excavation of relics to the collection of rare materials!  Our union members are active in a variety of fields!
