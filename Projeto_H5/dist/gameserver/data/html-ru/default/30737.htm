!Guild Member Morgan:

I am Morgan of the Aden Commercial Guild. If I am to speak of our commercial guild, I would say that it is a guild set up to unify the traders throughout the kingdom in order to restrain the Dwarven traders that are spreading their powers by the day. Protecting the rights and privileges of the upright traders that do business honestly in order to live from the high-handedness of the Dwarven Guild is the reason that we set up our guild. Of course, another purpose is to get more benefit through the interaction and connections between the traders. But to tell you the truth, from the perspective of results, trading ability is always found in good Dwarves.
