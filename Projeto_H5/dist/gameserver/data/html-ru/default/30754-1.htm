!Earthdragon Watcher Gilmore:
The core of the magic force field is a gateway that was created by those who locked away Antharas. A *portal stone* acts as a key to enter it. Another *earthdragon watcher, Theodric* is in charge of the portal stone and gives it only to authorized seal watchers.

If you would like to get a hold of a portal stone, first go see seal watcher Gabrielle. After you have been approved by her, come back and see me.
