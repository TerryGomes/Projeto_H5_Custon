Beast Herder Tunatun:

Hi! Welcome to the Beast Farm. My name is Tunatun and I'm the one in charge here. I got this job because I thought I'd be able to commune with the beasts. After all, my pet kitty back home absolutely loved me. On this farm though, it's not so easy.

As a matter of fact, I'm having a lot of trouble with these beasts. They tend to fight back if you try to feed or tame them, so I've hired a Feed Seller and various adventurers to help me manage and protect the farm. At this point, there's not much else I can do.
