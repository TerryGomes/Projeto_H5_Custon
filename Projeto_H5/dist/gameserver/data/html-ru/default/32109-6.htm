!Shilen's Stone Statue:

You know that in the past, Mother Shilen paid a great sacrifice to lock Sailren here.

Afterward, she created a stone likeness of herself and bestowed upon it the power to seal, making it a guardian of this place to ensure that Sailren remained imprisoned.

I am the stone statue of Shilen.

Mother Shilen also entrusted the power to seal to those who wield the sacred ax Gazkh.

I will only open the gate for those who have Gazkh and their friends. When the seal is at its weakest, however, I allow a warrior to enter in order to minimize the sacrifice.

There are not many of them, but Sailren is protected by its dinosaur followers. Combined with my enchantment and the power of the other statues, we are restraining Sailren and its followers from escaping. But as they begin to break free of our control, their power and magic also begins to extend beyond the Lost Nest, affecting even the Primeval Plains!

If the power of the Stone Statues are completely broken, Sailren and its followers will escape and this island and everything on it will perish.

Alas, Shilen is not here to protect us! In order to re-seal that horrifying dinosaur, you must defeat its followers first, and then work as a team to defeat Sailren.
