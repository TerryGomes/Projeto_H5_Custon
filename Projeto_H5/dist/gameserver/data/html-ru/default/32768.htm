Kelleyia:

I kept hearing so many rumors about the skill of those who inhabit the Beast Farm that I just had to see the talent for myself. And when I get here, what do I find?

A bunch of foul smelling, drooling, hideously deformed creatures... and I'm not talking about the monsters roaming the grounds of the Beast Farm.

All I see are a bunch of no talent, rowdy, trouble-making drunkards who don't know the slightest bit about skill.
