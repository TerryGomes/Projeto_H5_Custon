Officer Jakan:

Well, the Cokrakon, they might be the strangest of the life forms in this Seed. From a distance, you might mistake one for a man, but up close, their true form is revealed. Their appearance and behavior resembles that of territorial birds of prey. As with the other clans, they are capable of acts of nightmarish violence, but the one thing that will catch you off guard... their strange cry could make your head split open.

Some of the more intellectually curious minds among my soldiers talk of some evolutionary resemblence between the Bistakon and Cokrakon. I really couldn't say. In any case, be extremely careful here.
