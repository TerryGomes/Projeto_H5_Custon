!Mysterious Agent:

Greetings again. Don't worry, these mates are friends of mine, they won't hurt if you will be peaceful.

We have the proposition for you and your friends. None of us here likes Darion, the General of Beleth, but we're bound with the contract which Beleth has signed with us.

You know... we want to *kill General Darion*. But we can't! And I think this is the right moment to offer you this mission. Face and destroy *Darion, the General of Beleth*!

If you accept this offer, I will grant you with powerful support magic agaist Darion.

So, what you say ?
