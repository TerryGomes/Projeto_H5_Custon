!Engineer Lekon:

Airship, eh? If you want board an Airship, you need to first register for a Summon License. There's a switch on the Airship controls that proves your qualifications to summon and pilot it. Unless you obtain that license, you won't be allowed to fly.

Only *clan lords whose clan is level 5 or higher* may earn the license. There is also a limit on the number of Airships.

If you meet the requirements, you can obtain a Airship Summon License in exchange for *10 Energy Star Stones*.

An Energy Star Stone can be made by assembling Star Stones found floating in the skies over Gracia. If you thinkk this is too time-consuming, you can also buy them from Officer Tolonis right over there..
