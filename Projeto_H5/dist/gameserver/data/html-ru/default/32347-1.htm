The Ancient Text of the Demon is an old tome regarded as an unholy scripture by the Demons of Hellbound. It was created through the power of darkness and 
contains a mysterious energy, which can be very useful -- if you can obtain it, of course.<br>
You can find the Hidden First Page, the Hidden Second Page 
and the Fragment of a Contract with the Demon by reading this book. However, it will turn to dust if you try to use physical strength on it, 
so you must be careful.<br>
If you bring it to me, I can put it to good use -- it will be utterly useless to you, in case you had other ideas. But give it to me and I will exchange it 
for an item of greater value for you.<br>
