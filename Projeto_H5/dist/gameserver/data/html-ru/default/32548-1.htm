!Keucereus:

Gracia is in a very precarious situation.

After my father, King Paris, passed away, Gracia was engulfed in civil war. It finally ended, but the peace that followed was hardly complete. It was...a breathing space to llow the two sides to regain their strength.

Before that happened, however, the Priests of Darkness appeared. We thought they were only legends from the ancient books. Even the worshippers of Shilen didn't think they really existed. If my father did know about them, then he obviously didn't consider them much of a threat. But the time we realized they were, it was too late...

Seeds spawned from the world of Death sprouted throughout Gracia, spawning dangerous monsters. Except for those I saved, I doubt anyone survived the assault. Apart from those blasted pagans, of course.
