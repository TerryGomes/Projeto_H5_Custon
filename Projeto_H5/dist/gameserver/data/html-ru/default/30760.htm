!Sir Gustaf Athebaldt:

It s nice to meet you young man.  My name is Gustaf Athebaldt.  I am a knight of the royal bodyguards.  Although I will soon retire, when I see the current state of affairs, I worry so much about the future of this kingdom that I don t think I will be able to retire comfortably...

I don t think I can trust the future of this nation in the hands of kings or lords.  Lords are always busy pursuing and satisfying their own self-interest and gratification.  And the king always looks away from his people s hardships.  So, how would you expect them to be concerned about the nation s welfare?  If you think idly that it does not matter who rules over the country, you will find yourself in no time groaning under the harsh tyranny of a despot.

In my opinion, although we may have to go through hellish wars and tribulations, we must restore the order of the nation.
