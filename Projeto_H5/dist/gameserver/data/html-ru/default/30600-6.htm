!Speak to *Master Harant* or Master Trudy, and they will reveal teh skills and spells you may learn. 

You must understand that skills are divided into active skills and passive skills. *Active*  *skills* must be selected each time they are used, while passive skills provide a permanent increase to your basic abilities when they're obtained. As a Dark Fighter, you can acquire skills that increase your abilities.. 

When you reach Level 5, learn offensive active skills. *Power Strike, Mortal Blow, and Power*  *Shot* are the first three offensive active skills you may learn. Power Strike may only be used with sword type weapons, Mortal Blow with dagger types, and Power shot with bow type weapons. Power Shot, in particular, can cause great damage, but consumes great amounts of MP, so use it wisely. 

Ginally, if you have a few spare SP, then learning *Aura Defense* may be a good idea. This skill increases your defense, and is especially useful at your current levels, when your equipment is still rather weak.
