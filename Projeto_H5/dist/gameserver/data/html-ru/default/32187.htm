!Elder Nadir:

I heard the sound of your stamping feet before, haven't I? This is the holy altar of Nornil? Keep quiet and show reverence!

Do you intend to enter *Nornill's Cave*? Then be warned. It is the birthplace of most of the monsters on the Isle of Souls. Many Kamael have entered through the years; few have ever emerged.

You have chosen a thorny path indeed...
