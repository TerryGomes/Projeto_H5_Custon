The town's geographical features? Oh my... What a lazy chap. Have you no legs?

Even if you already know, the town is to the north-west, and to the south-east... It is divided up into 2 large areas like this. The shops are lined up above, and several guilds are situated on the bottom. These 2 areas are divided by a great canyon, and if you happen to fall into it, you will have a hard time climbing back up. So be careful.

There are 2 bridges that connect the northern and southern part of the town. In the past, the King accused us being of being a band of bandits. When he came to subjugate us, my grandfather and father disconnected the two bridges and fought for over 3 months until the King gave up. It was Duke Athebaldt, who made peace between the Hunters' Union and the King.

Why..., you do know, right? Did you not know? The son of the Duke is a Guildmaster at our town. I'm talking about Aren! He is quite a nice guy, even though he is from a noble family...
