!Maphr Priestess Chichirin:

 *Carna Maphra!* May the blessing of the Goddess of the Earth be with you.

The venerated *Hero Lucien* had enormous strength and willpower when he fought against the wicked *Earth Worm Trasken,* saving us Dwarves from the evil creature. Lucien once said, "I, Lucien, have always believed that the Goddess of the Earth is forever with me. Today s victory was only possible because of the blessing of the Goddess of the Earth!" What a wise remark!

We can learn a valuable lesson from Lucien, only those who truly believe in the Goddess's bounty will find what they seek!

 *Carna Maphra,* I'm sure that you too will be blessed if you keep true to your faith.
