!Vice Hierarch Casca:

Dragoon is a profession reserved for Kamael men only. At this level, you must choose whether to develop strength of spirit or body.

You will learn how to control and manipulate the dark power hidden in within ourselves.

Our weapons are Wooden Swords and Steel Swords â€” necessities for learning advanced skills at this level.
