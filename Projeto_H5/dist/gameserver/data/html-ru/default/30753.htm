!Gabrielle:
Giran, land of riches, is a place that appears bright and vital on the outside. But if you look carefully at the faces of the people that live there, you can see their dark shadows. That's because land dragon Antharas, who is called the tyrant of the land and disaster of Giran, is laying in Dragon Valley. If he stretches out and leave his lair, the prosperity and peace of that land will be broken completely.
