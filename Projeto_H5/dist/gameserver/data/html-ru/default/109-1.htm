!Jack Sage:


The Memories of a Newbie provides the "Newbie Support buffs", which can be received up to level 75, to veteran adventurer's of level 76 or more.<br>
This is an additional gift given by the Temple, so that all of you can focus on training. This is a small reward to all the great adventurers who fought on the front lines when our world was in danger. Please note that it will only be available *during the time I'm dispatched*.


You will receive the following buffs:

Warrior: Wind Walk, Shield, Magic Barrier, Bless the Body, Vampiric Rage, Regeneration, Haste.

Mage: Wind Walk, Shield, Magic Barrier, Bless the Soul, Acumen, Concentration, Empower.
