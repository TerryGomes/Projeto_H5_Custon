!Parina:

Are you learned? The world is made of *light and darkness* and four elements. Those four are no other than *water, fire, wind and earth.* All magic in this world is based on the powers of these six principles. That is why it is important, above anything else, for Mystics to understand the powers of that which composes this world.
