Investigator Sally:

I told you everything I learned before! But you know how much I love talking about plants, so ask away. OH! Also, I found out about a new species of Frog that lives on the Plains called the Rainbow Frog that might prove useful to you! I know, I know, I am pretty awesome like that... What can I say?
