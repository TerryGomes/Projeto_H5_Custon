!Elder Filaur:

May the blessing of the rich earth be with you. Welcome to the House of Elders, my dear young Dwarf. I, Filaur, am the representative of the glorious *Gray Column Guild* . I am a member of the Senior Guild Association, who rule the kingdom in the name of the *King of Dwarves* , who will return someday.
