!High Summoner Galatea:

Upper level elementals have the ability to converse intelligently with Humans, and are the ruling class of the elementals. The Magicians of the Ivory Tower have defined the hierarchy of elementals into Turen, Tilpo, and Liebe.

The elementals that have appeared in Gludio are the Flame Salamander, Earth Worm, and Water Undine. Originally, these elementals could only be seen in hot magma, high skies, the vast desert, or deep sea waters, but now they are here... It is noteworthy indeed that they have appeared in Human lands.

Have you met any of these elementals?
