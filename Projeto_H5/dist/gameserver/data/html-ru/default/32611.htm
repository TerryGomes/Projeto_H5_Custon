Officer Tolonis:

I am Officer Tolonis, and I'm in charge of delivering supplies like Energy Stones to adventurers.

I used to be a platoon leader, but after I was injured they gave me this posting. I'm proud of what I do here, but I miss the life of battle. Oh well, I suppose somebody has to manage supplies.

If you're interested in acquiring the collection skill, perhaps I can help.
