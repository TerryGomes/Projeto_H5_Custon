!Vice Hierarch Casca:

Only male Kamael who have been Dragoons may acquire the skills necessary to become a Berserker, which allow them to defeat their enemies and absorb their spirit to increase their own speed and power.

The heritage of the Berserker stretches far back to the misty origins of our race itself, to the great hero *Harkilgamed*, whose mighty sword sliced through the fabric of the heavens themselves.

Female Kamael simply do not possess the innate physical strength and unique magic of their male counterparts, which is essential for learning Berserker skills.
