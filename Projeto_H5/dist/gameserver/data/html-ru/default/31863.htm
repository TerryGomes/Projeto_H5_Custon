<font color="33CC66">Merry Chritmas, my little Adventurer!%%
To make your small Christmas tree, you will need:

<font color="0099FF">* Star Ornaments (4)</font>%%
<font color="0099FF">* Bead Ornaments (4)</font>%%
<font color="0099FF">* Fir Tree Branches (10)</font>%%
<font color="0099FF">* Flower Pot (1)</font>%%

Give me 10 small Christmas trees and I will give you a special Christmas tree, which has a magical effect of increasing health and magic regeneration while under its branches. Special Christmas trees can be summoned anywhere in-game, but you will not receive the magical effects of the tree if it is summoned anywhere inside peace zones.</font>
