!Elder Mao:

May the blessings of Nornil be with you!

If you travel south from here, you can see the Nornill's Garden, home of Nornil, Mother to this Isle of Souls. My name is Mao, and I am in charge of this place. If you can overcome the ordeals of this place and meet Mother Nornil, you may be reborn as a true Kamael warrior. There will be pain, but after the pain comes joy.
