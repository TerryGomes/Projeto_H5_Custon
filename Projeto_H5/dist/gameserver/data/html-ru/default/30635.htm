!Summoner Almors:

How do you do? My name is Almors. Such as it is, I am a Summoner in the Ivory Tower in Oren. Lying beside me is my partner, Pacco the cat.

 I am in the middle of recuperating here in my aunt's house, since the cold weather in Oren worsened my condition. Although I wish I could return to the Ivory Tower soon to finish my project... It isn't bad at all to spend the days here...
