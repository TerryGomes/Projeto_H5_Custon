!Researcher Kaplon:

Good lord! You really won't listen to this old man. Young lads lately have problems...tsktsk...

Ahem, anyway! I am one of the researchers dispatched by the Grey Column guild to research the Tower of Insolence! Our mission is to research the secrets of the tower, known as the greatest building in history.

If you decide to ignore my advice and continue on with your jouney here, I'll ask of you just one thing. There are two other researchers here, but they've not come back since researching that <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Vortex</font> over there. Let me know if you meet them? To go to the <font color="LEVEL">Upper Level</font>, they must use the <font color="LEVEL">Red Dimensional Stone</font>...
