!Neruga Chief Tantus:

Tejakar Paagrio! Praise the name of the Flame! This Immortal Plateau has been our sacred ground from ancient times, but while I, Tantus, was living among the humans of the *Kingdom of Elmore* , foreign invaders and Orc traitors brought disgrace to this land!

Now I am back, and I will not forgive those who disgraced our sacred place!
