!Grand Sorcerer Gallint:

Welcome. I am Grand Sorcerer Gallint of Einhovant's School of Wizardry. This is a school for Mystics, established by the famed alchemist Einhovant.

I was once an apprentice of his but he vanished soon after establishing this school, and I have not heard from him since. I wonder if he still lives...
