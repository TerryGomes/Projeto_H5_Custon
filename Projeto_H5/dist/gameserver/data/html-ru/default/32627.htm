Wizard Nottingale:

Welcome to Gracia! I am here to guide adventures who come from Aden.

It is impossible to walk around in Gracia because of the contamination caused by the Seeds. Most move via Airship, but that is also difficult -- there simply aren't enough for everyone.

The magicians of Aden crafted an alternative plan. It is called an *Aurabird*. I think it is the better solution for you.
