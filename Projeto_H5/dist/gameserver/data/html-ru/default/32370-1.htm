!Old Dwarven Ghost:

Yes, Naia. It's the Highest and the most dangerous tower among all! 

It's the lair of Beleth. You will need to get to the top of this tower in order to access the roof of Naia's tower.

But first you will meet Darion - the captain Guard of Beleth. He's tough emeny, but only defeating him will let you access to the Naia.
