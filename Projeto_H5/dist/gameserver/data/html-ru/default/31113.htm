!Merchant of Mammon:

May you receive the blessings of Mammon! We of the Mammon Guild have come far to show you some exquisite items!Before you start shopping there are a few things I should tell you... We don't accept today's currency, but instead use only *ancient adena*. Also, if you wish to purchase an enchanted scroll, you must bring a *blank scroll*.
