!Jack Sage:


The Oracle said that the great danger coming from the Frozen Labyrinth in the Schuttgart territory will affect the whole world. Since the Archbishop has received this revelation from Eva, his nights have been sleepless. He finally went to the Magic Research Institute and came to an important decision: the Gift of Vitality must be unleashed. This shall help Aden's adventurers to reveal their maximum potential.

The Gift was sealed centuries ago and a huge amount of money and effort from the highest ranked wizards was required for this decision to become real. The Magic Research Institute made it happen.

Now everyone must work together to face the approaching evil.
