!Keucereus:

There are many things we do not understand about the Seed. What we do know is that its interior is vastly different from the continent on which we live. 

We also know that its interior changes depending on who its lord is. In discussing the Seeds of Infinity and Destruction, think of the Seed of Infinity as a land of death controlled by undead lord and the Seed of Destruction as the land of Dragonkin controlled by the lord of Dragonkin. We are still attempting to learn more about the other Seeds, but we expect the same conditions apply.

Since they appeared, even the topography of Gracia has been altered. The land has become poisonous, making it nearly impossible to move except via airship or Aurabird. We do not know if we can ever restore this land to its former state, but our immediate goal must be to defeat the lords of the Seeds. Once they have been vanquished, we can turn our attention to reclaiming our land.
