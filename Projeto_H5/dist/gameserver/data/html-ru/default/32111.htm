<html><body>Orahochin:<br>
Welcome! My name is Orahochin, I am a proud warrior of the tribe Elroki! My mission is to guard this place. In fact, I guard the hope and the future of the tribe. Do you understand? Ah, my young friend, I hope your boots faster than your brain! Ha ha! <br>
Do you see the island over there? There you will find the village of innocent and peaceful Elroki. I can assure you that they are very different from degraded Elrokhians. <br>
I send to the island only those who don't hurt them. Ah ... You don't seem dangerous. If you want, I'll send you to the island.<br>
<a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest 6111_ElrokiTeleporters">Go to the island.</a>
