!Newbie Guide:

The protection blessing is a special protection given to *characters under level 39 who have not made* the second transfer.

While a character has this blessing, *he or she cannot either inflict or recive damage when* in combat with a chaotic character 10 or more level higher than they are. The protection does not apply to the battle field, however.

Would you like to recive the protection?
