!Dilios:

Currently, the Mounted Troop controls the Seed of Destruction. You must go there and defeat its captain, Tiat.

A command channel consisting of 5 parties should be established in order to attack the Seed. Then entry is possible through Sergeant Allenos, who has been dispatched there.

There is a time limit for attacking the Seed of Destruction, however. If you cannot carry out an assault within 2 hours, you will be expelled. The interior of the Seed is blocked by various obstacles, among them a powerful barrier protected by 3 devices.

Once you have broken through all the barriers and gates, you will reach the <font color="LEVEL">Fortress of Destruction</font>. If you can then defeat Tiat and his minions, victory will be ours!
