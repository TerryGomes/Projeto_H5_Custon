!Tataru Zu Hestui:

Tejakar Oroka! Nice to meet you, young traveler. I am the Tataru of the Hestui Tribe! I am one of the Shamans who passes on the teachings of flame from the god Paagrio!

The spells of the Orcs are to control the spirits through the authority of fire! We are entirely of a different level than the Elves who worship spirits like they were divinities and Humans, who misunderstand magic as science!
