Hmm? How strange it is for someone to speak to me. Aren't you afraid of me? Everyone avoids me, whispering that I am a leper or a pagan. They are a foolish race that is afraid or jealous if something is slightly different from themselves ...

Well ...! It is rather better for me. It is comfortable not having people bother you.
