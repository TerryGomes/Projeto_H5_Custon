Welcome!

It has come to our attention that area monsters have lately become increasingly powerful through their absorption of certain magical attributes. You have undoubtedly noticed that yourself, eh?

During my travels on the continent, I discovered a special technique that may allow us to defend ourselves against that attribute-enhanced power. It is far from fool-proof, but it may be our best chancel

Unfortunately, I require a variety of rare — and expensive — ingredients in order to manufacture the potion. My disciples are currently attempting to gather them at great risk to themselves. Perhaps you would be willing to help support their efforts?
