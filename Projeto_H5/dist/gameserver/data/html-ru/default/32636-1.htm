Watermeleons grow by drinking nectar! After planting a seed, if you pour the nectar on the Watermeleon, it will grow quickly!

After drinking enough nectar, the Watermeleon will become big. Then, if you hit it with a weapon, the Watermeleon will crack open!

But, there are several things you should be careful about!

*First of all, if you hit it before it's fully grown,* it will wilt from lack of nutrition. So be careful.

Also, since *a Watermeleon has a tendency to run away*, you should try to crack it open before it gets out of hand! Young Watermeleons that are not fully grown will run off in 3 minutes and fully grown Watermeleons will run away in a minute and 30 seconds!

*Also, a large Watermeleon can't be opened with a regular weapon!* I heard that there is a *weapon called chrono something* that produces musical sounds when you hit it against something. Only when you use that, you will be able to crack open your Watermeleon!

*One last thing! Since it's not easy to open a large Watermeleon by yourself,* you should find a friend who can help you open it.

Do you understand everything I've told you?
