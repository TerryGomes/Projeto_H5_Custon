Dorian:

Welcome! I waited for you for a long time ... I must tell you about a strong magical barrier that surrounds the Steel Citadel. If anyone who doesn't belong to the evil gets inside, the barrier will be activated, breaking apart all that will appear in this field. Fortunately, I know how to get around this magic. Do you want me to help you?
