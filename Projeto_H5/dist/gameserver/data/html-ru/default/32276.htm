Oracle Guide:You see flickering light inside the sphere. Suddenly you hear someone whisper!

<font color="LEVEL">"Crystals of the three colors</font>! Are you collected all? Excellent! I am the third child of the Oracle. With the power of the crystals I can call the <font color="LEVEL">Prince of Demons</font>, <font color="LEVEL">guardian of this island</font>.
He captured Parma. You have to destroy him to save her. What, you afraid? Well, then I'll send you back. Though it isn't in the rules of the Orcs, but you're not my only hope


<font color="LEVEL">Well, so what?</font>"
