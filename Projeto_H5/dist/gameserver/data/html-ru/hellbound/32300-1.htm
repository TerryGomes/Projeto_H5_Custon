!Bernarde:

I want to ask you for a favor. Do you know that my ancestors in the Old Temple Ruins have been disturbed? This is tragedy...

But you can give them peace by sprinkling the *Holy Water*. Here, take this bottle, it should be enough to calm their souls.

Pay me 5 Darion's Badges for the bottle to know that you're one of us.
