!Jude:

I heard that the native village is being often attacked. I don't know how those people have collected treasures, but it's the thing that Keltas wants.

Do me a favor, bring me those treasured until they're safe. I will reward you very well. Bring me *40 Native Treasures* as soon as possible.
