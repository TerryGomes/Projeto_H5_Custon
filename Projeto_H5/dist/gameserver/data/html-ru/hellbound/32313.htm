!Deltuva:

Welcome, traveler! I am assuming that since you know this place you must have heard about me from someone. I am here to help adventurers secretly enter the Steel Citadel. Unless you are already familar with the Steel Citadel, however, I cannot permit you to go inside. It is simply too dangerous for the inexperienced. So, then... what would you like to do?

[npc_%objectId%_tully_entrance|"Let me into the Steel Citadel."]
