Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:

I am Avant-Garde, the Transformatron Wizard. I have long wandered through the land and only recently settled here.

In fact? my young friend, I am not a wizard of the Ivory Tower. You look surprised! Heh. Think of me as a wanderer who acquired a special power quite by chance... My magic, however, requires some very specialized items.

If you have acquired these unique items from the dark wizard in Hardin's Academy, then perhaps I can help you.
