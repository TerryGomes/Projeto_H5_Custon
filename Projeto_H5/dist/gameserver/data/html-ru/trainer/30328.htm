Master Reisa:

When you fight, what emotion do you fight with? Novice Fighters shake with fear while experienced Fighters fight with the violence of a wild beast.But the highest level of Fighter maintains a calmness like still waters when fighting.

Therefore, skills differ according to the temperament of the warrior.
