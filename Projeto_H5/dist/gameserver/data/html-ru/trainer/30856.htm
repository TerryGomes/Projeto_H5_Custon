Sorcerer Winonin:

I am afraid of Desmond and I don't like him. He just says strange things every day. Drikiyan is like that and so is Desmond. Why are there so many strange Human mages all around..?

Ah, it is my lot to be the sacrificial lamb for the collaboration between Humans and Elves...! I must be the most unfortunate Elf mage in all the world...!
