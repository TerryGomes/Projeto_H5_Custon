Blacksmith Siger:

Nice to meet you. Buryun is my younger brother. Now be careful -- he gets upset at me a lot. Sometimes he shouts and stamps his feet. I really like crafting glittering swords. Customers like them, too.

I also count good. That's what Buryun tells me! Would you like to hear me count to 12?
