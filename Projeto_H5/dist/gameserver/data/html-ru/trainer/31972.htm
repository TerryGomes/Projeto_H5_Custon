Magister Atraxia:

I don't think I'll ever get used to this cold weather! Whenever I think I just can't bear it anymore, I think back to my days in the warm and cozy Elven Village...

Ah yes, the Elven Village... Even the magic there is nature-friendly and nice! It would make me so happy if the Elves that pass through hare would learn the magic that is their birthright and build pride in themselves as Elves. May Eva bless all Evas...
