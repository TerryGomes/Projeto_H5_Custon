Magister Anabel:

Long ago, Elves and Humans lived peacefully together in Innadril. But such was not the case in the Elven Forest, our hometown. One Elf was imprisoned for almost 100 years as punishment for loving a human.Even now, our elders are aghast at any mixing of the races... Although they may have a point, there is no stopping love, is there?

I am no foolish youngster, yet thinking of this makes me sentimental.
