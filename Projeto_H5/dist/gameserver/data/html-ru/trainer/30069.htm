Sorcerer Rollant:

It is not easy to become a Mystic. Do you know the call of power? Do you feel the force of nature? You must know the capacity to trust your heart with the energy of nature and accept that energy as a part of yourself. If you cannot do that, then you cannot even begin. In Dion, nature lives. It is a good place for Mystics to train.
