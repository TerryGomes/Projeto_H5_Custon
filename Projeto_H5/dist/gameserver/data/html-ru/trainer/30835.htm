!Lich King Icarus:

I haven't seen you before... You've got a face that overflows with vitality. Your face, your expression... I really like you... If it's OK with you, I'd like to check out how you are on the inside too...

Ah, your nonsensical expression is just excellent! Anyway, it's nice to meet you... I am Icarus. I've forgotten what my name was when I was alive... I am the only one of the thirteen Lich kings who shook the Elmoreden Kingdom long ago that is still alive... Well, to say that I'm a survivor is really a misuse of the word. Hee, hee...
