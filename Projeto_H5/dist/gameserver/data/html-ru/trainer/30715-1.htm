Magister Marina:

You do not need to worry, but the Grand Magister Fairen on the 4th floor is very sensitive these days because he is having dreadful dreams lately, so be careful.

Can you a imagine how a Dark Elf will act if he is actually 'sensitive?'

Well, I think its because he had too much sunlight while he was at the rooftop.
