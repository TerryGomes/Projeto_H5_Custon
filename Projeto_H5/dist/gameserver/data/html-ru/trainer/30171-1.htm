Sorcerer Galus:

My Master was named Metheus. He was a man who was not afraid of making mistakes or failure. He has made numerous achievements after hundreds and thousands of experiments. The research on amplifying magical powers was one of his most outstanding achievements. Bad things did occur... That is why we are having some set backs. But overall we did make some progress.*Spiritshots* are being used in some of the experiments now...
