Welcome, please open your book. Let's see where you have learned since...

What are you staring at? You're not here to learn magic? Ah, never mind about that chap over there. That idiot thinks the whole village is a Rogues Guild, and he thinks he will get assassinated because he knows that...

Ah, excuse me... That is... Magic... Do you wish to learn?
