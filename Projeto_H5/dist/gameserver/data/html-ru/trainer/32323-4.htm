Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:

You must remember that once you have transformed, you must not go into *deep water*. Once you have reverted to your original form, your soul will need time to recover -- you will not be able to transform again for some time. Understand?

Other than that... Each individual soul contains its own *unique chaiacter*. If you transform into something that matches that character, you may earn some benefits. Think of it as wearing a suit of clothes that fit you perfectly. Every race has its own respective "figure," so I advise you to do a little research about what kind of transformation would fit you best.
