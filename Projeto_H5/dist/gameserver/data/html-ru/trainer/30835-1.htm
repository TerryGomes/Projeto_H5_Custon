!Lich King Icarus:

What does it look to you like I'm doing here? Why do I have to listen to every kind of stupid question?... I am working to raise up the young scholars here. It means I'm passing on the necromancy techniques that I've learned in the past.

But don't get all afraid, now. The stories about Liches eating the bodies of Humans are just useless rumors... Of course, I tried that as an experiment once, but... Since we basically don't apply our magic to undead, we have no reason to eat Humans. Not only that, but Hardin has taken hold of my weakness... And so I've kind of got to follow the morality and norms of humans anyway.
