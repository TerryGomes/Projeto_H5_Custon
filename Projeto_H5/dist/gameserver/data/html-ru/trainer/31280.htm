Priest Bastian:

Since ancient times, the people of Elmore have nurtured and venerated the military arts... and not just the residents! The Einhasad Temple of Goddard shares a building with the Warrior guild, and has even given them their full support!

Naturally, this doesn't mean that we endorse violence! But history has taught us that in order to maintain peace and harmony, we must keep our military strong.
