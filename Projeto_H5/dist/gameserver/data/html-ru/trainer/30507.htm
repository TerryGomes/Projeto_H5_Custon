Seer Racoy:

The only eternal thing is the everlasting flame of the abyss!

Welcome, young Priest of Flame! I am in charge of helping those like you discipline themselves through training here in Gludio Castle Town. There are many things that dazzle our eyes, ears and mind in the world, but the correct attitude for training is to be strong and ignore them! Once you have a goal, there is no need to look at your surroundings. Just look at what is in front of you! But if something is blocking your way, get rid of it without hesitation, in the name of the holy flame!
