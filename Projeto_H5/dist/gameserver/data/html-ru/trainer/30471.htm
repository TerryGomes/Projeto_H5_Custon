Blacksmith Rupio:

Welcome, traveler! I'm Blacksmith Rupioof the Black Anvil Guild.

My younger brother Pushkin and I plan to make this establishment the most famous smithy in Giran. We just received the shipment of tools we've been waiting for from North Dwarf Village, so we're finally ready to show what we can do!
