Priest Tanios:

Elves worship Elvas and Andariel. Humans and young Elves know them better as Eva and Einhasad! Our religion is closely tied to the World Tree Glade. The World Tree Glade is the mother of all the trees in the world and acts as a messenger of the gods. The World Tree Glade of Innadril was cultivated from a small branch cut from the World Tree Glade in the Elven Forest. Through time the two glades have grown connected as one..
