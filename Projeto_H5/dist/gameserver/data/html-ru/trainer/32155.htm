Priest Nabot:

I pray that the divine blessing is upon you Welcome to the home of Einhasad's light... no, to this Human embassy. 

I suppose I should help you if I can, hmmm? What would you like me, a priest, to do for you?

Anything would be a refreshing respite from this dreary political conflict...
