Master Bronwyn:

I especially miss the Elven forest on days like this... It seems like only yesterday that I left the shadow of the Mother Tree and settled in this strange place, so far from my home... How quickly the years have passed!%%
But I shouldn't let my melancholy interfere with the business at hand, should I? Very well! What would you like to learn today?
