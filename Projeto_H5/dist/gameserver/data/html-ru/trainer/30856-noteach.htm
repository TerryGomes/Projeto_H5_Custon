Magister Winonim:

Are you kidding? I only teach Elven Mystics. Why should I waste my time on the likes of you!

Behold the mutterings of a foolish old Mystic, pontificating forward with his delusions of grandeur..

Sob! How I miss my hometown... If I could only stand once more at the foot of the beautiful Mother Tree!
