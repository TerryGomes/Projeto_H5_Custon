Master Arti:

It is good to see you! I must tell you that Innadril is much more dangerous than it appears. Of all the islands around Innadril, not one of them is safe. The Field of Reeds is a nest of thieves, anything shiny will be stolen... Heine is no better.

We must arm ourselves and restore security to our city.
