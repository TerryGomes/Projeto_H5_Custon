Seer Lazenby:

Dejakyar Paagrio!

One who holds the flame close to heart, welcome. I, Lazenby, am prepared to teach you skills in order to further the prestige of the flame.

There are not only adventurers seeking treasure in this village, but also various races and organizations that pass through here. I can't allow a naive child of flame to roam around and bring disgrace to the name of Paagrio!
