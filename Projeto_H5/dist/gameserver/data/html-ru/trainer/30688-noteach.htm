Blacksmith Duning:

How can someone so young be so forgetful! I'm a Dwarf and a blacksmith, you fool! I am not a Warehouse Keeper!

You can stand around as long as you want, but I will never teach you anything about blacksmithing!

...Oh, and by the way, we don't sell anything here so just run along if there is something you want to buy.
