Prefect Kasman:

The low Orcs are the remnants of those tribes that revolted against our Kingdom's rule and became independent, only to be utterly defeated. They detached themselves from the center of Orc civilization and created their own culture a long time ago. But really, you can't call it a culture since they're uncivilized and barbarous.

I, Kasman, do not accept them as Orcs! It doesn't matter if we share the same ancestors with them. We should purify them with the power of Paagrio. We should burn away our shame!
