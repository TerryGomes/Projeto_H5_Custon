Priest Dustin:

Welcome, young friend, to the holy grounds of Einhasad. The Priests here teach Mystics the mysteries of the miraculous light granted to us by the gods.

The magical powers of light must only be used for healing and protection. However, there are those who forget this basic principle, and use the divine power as a tool of war. I believe that you will not be guilty of such an error, and so I will teach you. Please do not make me regret my faith in you.
