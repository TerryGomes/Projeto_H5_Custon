Magister Otillo:

Drat! Failed again! Oh, did you need to see me? Ha! Don't hold back your laughter! I was experimenting with magic to make my body flexible, but as you see... I've become petrified! An unfortunate side effect! Hmm, but it seems I partially succeeded! Look! My mouth is quite flexible, isn't it? Ha!

Do you want to try this magic? You shouldn't worry about the side effects too much... The stiffness goes away eventually, usually within a day. You look tired, so you could probably use the rest!
