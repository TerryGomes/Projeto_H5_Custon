Magister Talia:

We all serve the father, Gran Kain... The time of greed and anger will soon end, and a bright future awaits us.

Brothers and sisters! There will be a gruesome judgement for the betrayers! The Dark Elven history of betrayal will change to a history of joy! We shall all prepare for that day!
