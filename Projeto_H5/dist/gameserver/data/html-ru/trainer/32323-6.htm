Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:

If your subclass skill is above a certain level, you can transfer that poower to you main class.

Because this is a very dangerous mission, however, you must be certified in order to carry it out.

If you were certified by your subclass master and have brought the certificate, I will transfer some of your subclass power to your main class.

Be warned: this will inflict a serious shock to your soul. You must strengthen it in preparation for this rite.

In order to learn certified subclass skills, you must first speak to Hardin and obtain the first sealbook. Hardin's Academy is in Dragon Valley.

Do you wish to proceed?
