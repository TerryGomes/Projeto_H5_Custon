Blacksmith Wilbert:

Ha ha! It's a big mistake to think blacksmiths only make armor, swords, spears, axes, plows and the like. If not for our Black Anvil Guild craftsmen, Aden Castle would have collapsed a long time ago.

And there's a rumor that the giant Golem recently used by the rebel army to expel their Human lords was acquired from the guild. Who else possesses that kind of skill?
