Master Orkurus:

I am Orkurus, a Master of the Kamael Guild here. Is this your first visit to Oren Castle Town? Unique, is it not? Some say the atmosphere here is dreary and dark, but I do not think so.

In fact, it feels very much like home to me â€” no unnecessary ornamentation or frivolity. What do you think?
