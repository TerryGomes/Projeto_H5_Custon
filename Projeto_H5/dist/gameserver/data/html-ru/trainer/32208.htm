Master Rasha:

Welcome! If I have not misjudged you, you are shrinking from something. Are you passive by nature, or did you lose courage through your dealings with these foreign races? Whatever the reason, stick out your chest and hold your head up high. Do not forget that we are Kamael: strong, fearless and proud.
