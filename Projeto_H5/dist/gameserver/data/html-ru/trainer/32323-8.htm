Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:

It is a tremendous endeavor to obtain subclass certification and learn the appropriate skills. Beyond the purely physical effort, the burden on your soul is beyond your imagination... It is almost a suicidal venture.

However, the process can be undone. There is a special kind of herb that can be used to remove your previously chosen skills. The price of the herb, though, is approximately *10 million adena*... I have the herb here, so I can cancel the certification anytime once you have paid.

If the certification is canceled, *the current certification status and skills will vanish immediately -- poof!* Now then, do you really wish to cancel certification?
