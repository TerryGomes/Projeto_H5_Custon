Master Auren:

I am Auren, the head of the Kamael Guild here. Always a pleasure to meet someone like yourself. Not to complain, but this place can leave one feeling very lonely and isolated.

Have you met Duroga? I suspect that his cold exterior is simply a mask to hide those feelings of loneliness.

I feel sorry for him, although his attitude towards me has been very disrespectful.
