Prefect Dowki:

You came to the right place.

Fighters like you should always train hard and be ready to sacrifice anything at any time for the Orcs.

First, to learn skills, you need experience. I cannot simply explain to you how to be a great Fighter, you must actually experience the situations I teach you about.

Once you have the needed experience and learn from my words, then those skills will be yours. Now, consider your ability and select a skill that you want to learn.
