Master Aiken:

Because of the Dwarven bandits called the Magpie Brothers, the National Cemetary has fallen into disrepair recently. And all kinds of followers have appeared too.. The divine protection given to the Dwarves by Maphr is not so that they can dig in the ground and get the things that are buried in graves...

Not long ago, I gave training to the guards in Dwarven techniques of capture.
