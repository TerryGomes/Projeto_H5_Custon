Sorceress Harne:

Welcome, young one. Do you seek to learn the mystery of magical powers 
that make the spirits of darkness shiver in fear? Do you want to learn the secrets of 
magic that Gran Kain whispers in your ear in your nightmares? 
Throw away all fear and prejudice -- I will open a new road for you.
