Sorcerer Hanellin:

The king of this country had no idea what was happening deep within his own land because he spent his time looking outside the kingdom.

Rivals in every place maintain their gaze on taking this castle. Elves scrunch up their eyes and say all kinds of thing about the times... But us Dark Elves don't criticize at all. Humans are more fun. They talk like Elves but act like us Dark Elves. Anyway, they are a cute race that are different on the inside and outside... OK!
