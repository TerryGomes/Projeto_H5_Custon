Sorceress Mirien:

What was your first impression of Dion like? I don't know if you felt it, but Dion is a land overflowing with magical power. In my opinion, it has to do with the ruins of the giants to the north of the village. The giants of ere are known to have been the most remarkable race. Their mysterious power may be related to the magical power of this land.
