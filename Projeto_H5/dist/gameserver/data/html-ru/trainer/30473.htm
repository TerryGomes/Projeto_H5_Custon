Priest Bandellos:

Welcome, child of the forest. May the blessing of starlight rest upon you.

This massive building is the temple where Humans serve Einhasad. As an Elf who worships beneath the sky and among the trees, I cannot understand why they serve the heavenly Gods in such a crude stone building as this.

However, since you have come out to the Human world, it is best that you follow its traditions. Now, let us begin your studies.
