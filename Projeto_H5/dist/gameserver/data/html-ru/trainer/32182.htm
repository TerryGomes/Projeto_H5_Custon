Master Coplan:

Do you know the legend about the ancient heroes who saved the Isle of Souls from destruction against a powerful invader? This Hills of Gold was the site of a hard-fought battle where one of those heroes gained victory with the help of a golden shield that defended him against enemy attack. Perhaps it is only a legend, but I feel the presence of that legendary hero when I meditate here. I cannot explain it, but it is as though I can tap into his spirit, filling me with power.
