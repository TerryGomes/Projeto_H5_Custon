Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:

After you have been guided through the process of transformation by a wizard, you may transform youiself into another shape by bunging a transform sealbook to me.

Know that it is no easy task to earn one. I have heard, however, that you may find one through the Marketeer of Mammon or the Adventure Guild.
