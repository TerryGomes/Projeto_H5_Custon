Magister Xenovia:

Recently the streets have been swaming with doomsayers, most babbling something about the return of Shillen. I wouldn*t be surprised to find that renegade forces within the temple were behind all this.

Although all Dark Elves have at the least a deep respect for Shillen, these false prophets are most assuredly not endoresed by the elders. They are just rabble-rousers who need to be taught a lesson...

I must admit that my weapons skill is lacking, but I do have some other skills you might find interesting...
