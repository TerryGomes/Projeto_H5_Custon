Master Iker:

Welcome, friend of magic. The potent magic of the Ivory Tower, which I teach, is entirely different from the spells of uncivilized Orcs, or the servile magic of the Elves, who flatter the spirits.

Keep your wits about you and heed my words. Your eyes will soon open to the true grandeur of magic.
