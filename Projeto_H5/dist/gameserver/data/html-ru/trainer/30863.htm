Master Ghest:

Battle is the clash of strong wills that try to destroy the other person. The ferocious beasts that are hunted in the fields all know this well. But our civilized races have forgotten this fact due to having lived in peace, if even for a short time.

If you've got in your hands the fierceness to truly make your enemies afraid, you must first realize how important is the malice that you have.
