Master Fiske:

You know the old Kamael saying, "The Nomil sees all your deeds?" Since being sent here, I have frequently pondered this saying. I find that it fills me with pride and awe, thinking that everything I do here wins me credit or causes me shame in the NorniPs eyes.

It certainly inspires me to do my best, whatever the task at hand. What can I do for you?
