Seer Takina:

What do you think keeps a seer such as I here in this city of water, so greatly praised by Humans and Elves?How I long for the sound of the wild wind screeching against the wall of my beloved northern fortress...

I have come here to warn those who believe that they are somehow protected from the chaos that swirls around them! Their peace and happiness shall soon be wrenched from them!

Dear friends, you must prepare for the cold darkness ahead!
