Master Stedmiel:

Have you been to the Enchanted Valley? It is said that fairies live there, hidden. In the past, there was a strange trend of collecting parts of a fairies' body and that is why the Fairies and the King of the fairies' hid in the woods.

If this is true how frightened will they be, watching the vast amount of adventurers searching the place...? May the song of stars give you happiness.

Now, what can I do for you?
