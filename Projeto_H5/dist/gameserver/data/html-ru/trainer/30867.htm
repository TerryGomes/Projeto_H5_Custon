Seer Reva:

Behold. I am Reva, Seer of Paagrio. I come to visit Aden the capital of human kingdom to relay the message of Paagrio. Old orcs are sensing that the endless winter is approaching.  This must be felt by the leaders of humans and of the other five races.  Everyone must prepare for war.  Kill the enemies who are blocking our path and pave it with their blood. Only the peace so obtained will bring us glory! Tejakar Oroka!
