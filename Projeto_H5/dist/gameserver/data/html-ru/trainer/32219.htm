Master Fabnor:

Welcome! This village certainly seems like a quiet, peaceful place, does it not?

Ah, but appearances can be deceiving, my friend.In reality, the different races feud behind the scenes with deadly intensity. There are even rumors of assassins for hire roaming the streets.

I don't know whether that is true or not, but you should certainly keep your wits about you while you are here.
