Transformation Wizard Avant-Garde:

To learn the magic of transformation, you will need to receive special training.

Find the Wizard of Darkness, who lives at Hardin's Academy. He will open the path to transformation.

You must have reached at least *level 50* to embark on this path.

You will also need a special seal. I do not know how you can obtain it, but without it transformation is impossible.
