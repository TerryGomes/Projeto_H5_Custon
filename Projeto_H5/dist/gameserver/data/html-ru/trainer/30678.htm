Blacksmith Helton:

Hmmph, who are you? Why did you come here? Unless you've brought a keg of beer, I have no time to spare in idle chatter.

Heat it, heat it, bake it, cool it down! That's my craft! Through fire and water, I fashion stout armor and blades sharp enough to cut the wind itself.

What do you want?
