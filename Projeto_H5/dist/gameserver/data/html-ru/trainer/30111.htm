Sorcerer Dieter:

You who search for the truth of magic, welcome. I perceive a strong passion for knowledge in your eyes... Yes, one must truly desire learning in order to become a potent Mystic.

However, there are those who become blinded by their greed for knowledge, who begin studying forbidden magic.Excessive curiosity can lead to destruction. You must be careful to bridle your passion!

Well then, shall we begin the lesson?
