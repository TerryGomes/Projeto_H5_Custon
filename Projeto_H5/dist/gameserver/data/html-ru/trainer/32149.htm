Magister Ennear:

Welcome, adventurous souls.

I am Ennear, a magician from Innadril. We Elves are known as the founders of all magic, but we would be remiss if we did not acknowledge the contributions of both the Dark Elves and even the Humans. But the Kamael have no system remotely like ours or any of the other races.

From where, I must wonder, do they draw their power? I would give much to find out that secret...
