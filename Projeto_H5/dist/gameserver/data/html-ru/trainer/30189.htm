Priest Rovia:

Greetings, I am Rovia.

This place is right on the border with Elmore, that is why the houses and people may seem rather foreign. Quite different from the Elves, wouldn't you say?

The houses are crude and rough and the men are far from refined. The further you go into Elmore, the more you'll find the culture to be crude. It's very hard for an Elf to feel at home here, harmony with nature is not exactly revered.
