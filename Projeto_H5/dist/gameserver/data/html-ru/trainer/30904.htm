Master Naiel:

In Innadril there are more worshippers of Eva than of Einhasad. Accordingly, the temple of Eva is the much more magnificent of the two... Eva's followers in Innadril seem to have a slightly differnt view or their goddess than is widely accepted. This is no doubt due to the influence of the indigenous religions. It can be quite a shock to an unaccustomed Elf...

The High Priest of the Einhasad Temple is in charge of the class transfer of Clerics and all clan-related business. I hope zhis isn't confusing you.

Oh, but the way, the most important thing : I teach Elves Warriors.
