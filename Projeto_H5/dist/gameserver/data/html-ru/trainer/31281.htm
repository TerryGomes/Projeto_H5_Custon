Priest Cerenas:

Dear traveler from a faraway country! May the peace of the lake and blessings of light be with you always...

As you can see, the temple of this village also serves as the Warrior guild. Our society reveres military power as much as we venerate religion.

But military power can be a two-edged sword. Although necessary for survival, always remember that the sword that saves your life today may cut you down tomorrow!
