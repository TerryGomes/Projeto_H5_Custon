Sorceress Juria:

To the north of this village is a massive ravine. 
That place is a gathering place for dragons such 
as worms or drakes; so it was named the Dragon Valley.

Many hunters desiring a worm's scales or a drake's 
claw rashly venture into that valley, only to lose their lives. 
That is because the green dragon Antharas has summoned 
malignant spirits to protect its home.

If you are thinking of going there, you must be especially careful.
