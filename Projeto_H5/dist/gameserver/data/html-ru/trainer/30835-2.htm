!Lich King Icarus:

Did you say Hardin...? I've been friends with that guy for a very long time... But I still don't know much about him. Sometimes he leaves this academy and goes out for a long time. And when he does that, even I don't know where or what he's doing. But that is something that would definitely surprise an ordinary person like yourself...

Based on Human standards, he acts very properly and justly. But in fact, he doesn't think of that as being even as important as the hair of an undead. I believe that someone like him is in a region that is not effected by laws, norms and ethics...
