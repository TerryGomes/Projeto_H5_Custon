Master Noir:

Welcome. I am Master Noir of the Kamael Guild here. As you may know, Giran is a center of trade and the Traders Guild has need of exceptional warriors.

The Fighters Guild believes they can provide those, but their pride will be their downfall. Our Kamael Guild will easily produce more skilled and battle-ready warriors than they could ever hope to do.
