Master Belkis:

The joy one feels after slaying one's prey with a well-balanced weapon is indescribable! A true Kamael hunter should depend solely on his own power, sword or magic.

Ah, I miss those carefree days, when I followed the wind and clouds, slept under the stars and was answerable only to my belly. What do you say? Do you want a life of adventure, or one of humdrum?
