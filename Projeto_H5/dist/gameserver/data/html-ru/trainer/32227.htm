Master Digler:

An evil aura has settled over this village, like a mist forming on the surface of a pond. Can you not feel it? A dark shadow of hate and revenge lurking in the streets and alleys?

I do not mean to alarm you, but I must impress on you the need to stay alert. I sense that this place could erupt into violence at any moment...
