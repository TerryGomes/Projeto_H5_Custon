Master Luther:

This Hunters' Village has something like an uncompromising attitude of mind, characteristic of anarchy. As you know you can catch various strange creatures, right?

Not just because of that, but Lords of various regions tried very hard to control this village. However, every time they tried they only heard things damaging their pride. The biggest mistake made by them began from a misunderstanding. There aren't any common 'Hunters' here...

Remember that. Well, let's see if you fit in to this village?
