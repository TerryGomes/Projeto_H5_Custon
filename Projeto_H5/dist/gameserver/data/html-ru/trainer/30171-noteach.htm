Magister Gaius:

I don't think that you're somebody I can teach. Why don't you go upstairs? Gauen is younger that other Elves, but he might be an excellent teacher for you. On the other hand, there is also Kaiena. She may be a little difficult to deal with at times, but she is an accomplished magus.

Be aware that we don't deal with clerics here. If that is your calling, you'd best go to a temple.
