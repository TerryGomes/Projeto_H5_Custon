Sorceress Ramoniell:

In the morning I must organize the magic materials and do the cleaning, and in the afternoon I must lecture in  Basic Understanding of Magic.  In the evening, I have to study magic to improve my own skills and meditate. Can t you see how busy I am? So please, just get to your point quickly.
