Master Aerina:

Darkness has always been the realm of the Dark Elves... or has it? What if that was just the propaganda of those snobbish Elves? Think on it!

After all, it is because of them them the whole world believes we belong in the shadows!

They use their fair skin and disarming smiles to charm and persuade, but it is a facade! We Dark Elves must never ignore the snide hatred that lurks behind their pretentious smiles!
