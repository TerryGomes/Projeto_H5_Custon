Sorceress Juria:

May the tranquility of the still lakes be with you. It is a great joy to meet my own folk in a strange foreign land.

When one looks at the energetic Humans here, one may think that their lives are lived  without knowing peace or prosperity, but even here, there is a *dark shadow* that cannot be seen on the surface.

You will gradually come to know the true character of darkness. As one who studies magic, you must not judge things hastily by their outer appearance. Remember this.
