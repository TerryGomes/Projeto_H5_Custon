Magister Gaius:

Welcome, seeker of wisdom. You've done well coming here during the Chaotic Chronicles. The Ivory Tower welcomes you.

We Magicians must understand the perils of our craft. Mistakes have been made by our predecessors and even by the Elves. The fact remains, magic is, although mysterious, just a tool.

My master knew this very well.  We who follow in his footsteps have mixed feelings about what he did 50 years ago...
