Sorcerer Moses:

Hey, welcome to the Mystics Guild of Hunters Village. This village may look calm and peaceful, but dreadful secrets lurk around here. For instance, there is a group of Assassins who would even kill the royal family if they were paid.

Shh! Don't tell this to anyone else. Do you think one of the Assassins would let you live after hearing that?

Well... No more gossiping...
