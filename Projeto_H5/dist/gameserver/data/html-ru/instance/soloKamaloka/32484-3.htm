Pathfinder Worker:

To begin, I'll tell you about the enemies. *Kanabion* - not just a monster, a creature that appeared as a result of the connection of evil and darkness.

Our goal - to destroy them and prevent the location Kamaloka in Aden.

If you kill enough Kanabions, then we'll give you some ammunition. In time we'll assign you a grade *from D to S*, depending on your results.

Or we can return collected by you with Kanabions *Essence of Kamaloka*. But in the real world there are no places where they can use.

Give them to us, if you think that you do not need. We offer appropriate compensation.

And if you die Rim Kamaloka, nobody can help you before time runs out or of stay until the moment when all will be defeated. It's your dream.

So our technology will allow you to be Rim Kamaloka within *20 minutes*. Do not forget about it.
