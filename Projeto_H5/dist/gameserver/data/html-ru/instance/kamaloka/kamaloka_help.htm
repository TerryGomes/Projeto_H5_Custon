Kamaloka is an invader from another world. Its origins are a mystery, but we discovered a sealed space similar to a Dimensional Rift. We named it Kamaloka.

Before you attempt to enter it, you should know some basic information. You cannot enter Kamaloka alone.

Neither can too many individuals enter at once: no more than 6, according to the priests.

There is also a limitation about how often you may enter. The priests say that, just like entering a Dimensional Rift, your spirit needs time to recover from the journey across worlds. Prepare yourself well! (In real time, you can enter Kamaloka only once per day.)

Kamaloka is also open only to characters near its own level. (Only characters within 5 levels of the Kamaloka's level may enter.)
