I am a trader sent by the Lord to sell the manor's seeds and purchase indigenous products.

The seeds that I'm selling can be sowed only in this manor. However, the indigenous products can be sold to any castle. For a small commission, I'll sell them on behalf of you to other manors in other castles.

The sale and purchasing of seed starts from 8 p.m. everyday. Look up information of the manor posted from 6 a.m., get prepared ahead, and come back at 8 p.m.  Hurry up before the goods are sold out, ha, ha.

If you have any such indigenous products, I will buy them from you now. The Lord will be pleased.

Don't be embarrassed if you don't know the meanings of some of the words I use, such as "manor" or "indigenous product". All questions will be answered, you need only ask.
