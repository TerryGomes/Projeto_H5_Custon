When a seed germinates inside a monster it becomes a crop. The best crops are harvested from monsters of a level similar to the sower.

Bring your harvested crops to me and you will be rewarded. The lord usually compensates farmers with items, some much more valuable than the crops.

Of course, you should be willing to gamble a little, right?
