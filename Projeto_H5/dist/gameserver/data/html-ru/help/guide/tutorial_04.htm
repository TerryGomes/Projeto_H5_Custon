Good work. Now you will learn about enlarging and shrinking the screen using the mouse wheel.
<br>If you rotate the 
<font color="LEVEL">mouse wheel</font> down, you enlarge the game screen. Rotate the wheel up to reduce the screen.
<br>
The more you turn the wheel, the larger or smaller the screen becomes, but notice that there is a limit to how far you can go in either direction.
