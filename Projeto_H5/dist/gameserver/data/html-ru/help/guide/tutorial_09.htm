<font color="LEVEL">[Picking Up Items]</font>
</center>
<br>
When you defeat monsters, they drop their items on the ground. Move your cursor over to the dropped item, and the cursor will change its shape to a hand-shaped icon, indicating that the item may be picked up. Left-click on the item to pick it up.

<br>
There is another way to pick up an item. Press the <font color="LEVEL">F4 key</font> and you can automatically pick up nearby items. Currently, the fourth slot on the shortcut bar is registered with the pickup action and therefore, when you press the F4 key, that action is activated.
