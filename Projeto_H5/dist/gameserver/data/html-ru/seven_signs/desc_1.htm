<font color="LEVEL">[What are the Seven Signs?]</font>
<br> 
During the era of the Elmoreden kingdom, seven powerful magic seals were created. These seals were created by borrowing the power of Einhasad, the goddess of light for the purpose of restraining the power of Shilen, the goddess of death. The seals contain tremendous power that could throw the entire world into turmoil. 
<br> 
Two groups, the Lords of Dawn and the Revolutionaries of Dusk, are competing to take the possession of the power of the seals. Players may join one of the groups and compete against the players of the other group. 
<br> 
The Lords of Dawn are castle-owning clans and alliances. The opposing Revolutionaries of Dusk have no such affiliations. Thus the contest boils down to a battle between those who own castles and those who do not.
