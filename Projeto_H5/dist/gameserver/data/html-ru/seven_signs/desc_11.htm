Merchant of Mammon:
<br>
A blank scroll is the papyrus that remains after the enchantment has been removed from a magic scroll.
<br>
Visit <font color="LEVEL">Gatekeeper Ziggurat</font> at the entrance to the Necropolis, he'll tell you how to get a blank scroll. But this knowledge won't come cheap...
<br>
He's been a bit down on his luck lately... This will do him good...
