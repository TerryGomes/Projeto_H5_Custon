Festival Guide:

<font color="LEVEL">[Return to Village]</font>
<br>
If you wish, I'll send you back to the village from where you came. Oh, be careful! If you are in possession of a blood offering that you have obtained during the festival, it will disappear as soon as you return to the village.
<br>
And, if you wish to return to the oracle from the village, speak with the priest in the village.
<br>
Do you really wish to return to the village?
