Merchant of Mammon:

A blank scroll is the papyrus that remains after the enchantment has been removed from a magic scroll.

Visit *Gatekeeper Ziggurat* at the entrance to the Necropolis, he'll tell you how to get a blank scroll. But this knowledge won't come cheap...

He's been a bit down on his luck lately... This will do him good...
