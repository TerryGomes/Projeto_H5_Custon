Black Marketeer of Mammon:

Out of respect for the traditions of the old empire, both the Lords of Dawn and the Revolutionaries of Dusk use *Ancient Adena* as their currency.

Certainly, traditions and customs are important, but in this day and age... If you go to the market with those ancient coins, you won't be able to buy anything! Right?

Say, do you have any Ancient Adena weighing down your purse? I can help you.

Also, if your weapon carries a special capability you no longer want, I can remove it. No questions asked!

I also carry rare goods that you won't find anywhere else. Stop by and see for yourself some time. You might just find a once-in-a-lifetime deal...
