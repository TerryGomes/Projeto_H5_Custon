Blacksmith of Mammon:

Do you know about the Foundation Items? Even we blacksmiths see them only infrequently.

These uncommon items are brought into being by a power than goes beyond mere chance. We Dwarves say that it is the blessing of Maphr.

That perfect craftsmanship is beyond the Human race's capacity.

It is not, however, beyond mine. Bring me *Mammon's Varnish Enhancer, which is sold by the Merchant of Mammon*. Then I will use techniques known only to me to transform the item into something accessible to mortals.

Be sure to select a helmet among the rare items that provides you with a useful power. Don't worry if you make the wrong choice, though. You will have another chance to make a selection.
