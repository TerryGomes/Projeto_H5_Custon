<font color="LEVEL">[Necropolises]</font>
<br> 
A necropolis is an ancient temple, hidden deep underground. The recent discovery of an ancient scroll has disclosed its location. If you slay Nephilim, Gigant, Lilim and Lith there, you can obtain seal stones. 
<br> 
The necropolises are linked to the seal of avarice. During the competition, you can go in and out of the place freely. But during the seal validation period, only members of the group that owns the seal of avarice can enter it. If the outcome is a draw, both sides are allowed to enter and exit.
