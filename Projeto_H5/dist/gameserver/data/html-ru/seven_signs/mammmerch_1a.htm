Merchant of Mammon:

Ancient adena is the currency that was used during the Elmoreden Empire. It was minuted from gold of the highest purity, of a much higher quality than the coins used today. It is said that the emblem on the back of the coins possesses a mysterious power...

The Lords of Dawn and the Revolutionaries of Dusk are given bonuses in ancient adena. Sell them *seal stones* and they'll pay for them with ancient adena.
