!I am the Head Blacksmith who has trained famous Dwarven Warsmiths. Someone like you doesn't have anything to learn from me.
However, remember this. The equipment you are currently wearing would never have existed if we, Dwarven Blacksmiths were not around. That is why Dwarven Blacksmiths are important.%%
Ah, by any chance if you are a Scavenger go visit the Warehouse Chief. Never mind, if you are not.Â
