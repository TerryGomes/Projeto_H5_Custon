!To be a Warsmith, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Maestro.

Oh, what have you done until now? You haven't collected all of the marks yet? Come back after collecting all of the marks. If you collect all of them and come to me I will change your occupation to a Warsmith.Â
