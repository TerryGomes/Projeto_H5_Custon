!To be an Overlord, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the Lord.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation to an Overlord.Â
