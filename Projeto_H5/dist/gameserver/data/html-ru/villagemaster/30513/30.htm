!To be a Warcryer, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Glory, and the Mark of the War Spirit.

You have acquired the level but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all marks. If you fulfill these obligations, I will change your occupation to a Warcryer.Â
