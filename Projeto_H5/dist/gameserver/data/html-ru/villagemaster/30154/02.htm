!Hierarch Asterios:

A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. I'm afraid you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. An Elven Mystic like yourself can change profession to become an *Elven Wizard*, who practices elemental magic, or an *Elven Oracle*, who studies divine power. Which profession do you wish to know about?
