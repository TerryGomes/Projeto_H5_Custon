!Hierarch Asterios:

A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. I'm afraid you cannot change your profession here. However, I can give you some information. If you are an Elven Fighter, you can change profession to become an *Elven Knight* or an *Elven Scout*. Which profession do you want to learn about?
