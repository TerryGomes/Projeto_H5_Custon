!Warehouse Chief Reed:

Ours is the largest and most powerful of the 6 Dwarven guilds, dating back nearly 1,000 years and made up of only the most skilled traders and bankers. We have warehouses in every city on the continent! In fact, our commerce knows no borders -- our customers stretch from the barren lands of Lansk to the innermost depths of Kardif across the ocean. Any business, anywhere, at any time! What other guild can boast as much?
