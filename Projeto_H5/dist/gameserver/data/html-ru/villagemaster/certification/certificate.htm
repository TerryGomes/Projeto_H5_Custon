!Subclass Skill Certification

Once you reach a certain level of skill in your subclass, you skills can be certified.

As a result, you will be able to learn some special skills which you can use in your main class.

However, each subclass slot can have only *one certification*.

That means that even if you come back with a different occupation for the subclass, you cannot obtain another certification unless you first spend a *huge amount to cancel the first certification*.

If you want to obtain a certification, *your current occupation should be that of the subclass you want to be certified, and you should be above level 65*.

Now, do you wish to be certified for this subclass?
