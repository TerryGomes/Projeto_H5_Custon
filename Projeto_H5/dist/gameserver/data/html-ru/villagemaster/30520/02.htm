!Warehouse Chief Reed:

The fundamental characteristics of *Scavengers* and Artisans are that the Scavenger collects rare materials and the Artisan makes something valuable from those materials. Therefore, a Scavenger must have above average physical strength and combat abilities. He is a great hunter who will brave any danger to collect valuable materials.

The most talented Scavengers are selected to be *Bounty Hunters*. Bounty Hunters go to the extreme to find arcane items like dragon scales.
