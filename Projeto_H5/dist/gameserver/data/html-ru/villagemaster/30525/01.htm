!Head Blacksmith Bronk:

To change profession means that you have attained a certain degree of ability and experience, and may be promoted to a higher-level profession. You cannot change profession here, however I can give you some information. If you are a Dwarven Fighter, you can change profession to become an *Artisan* or a *Scavenger*. Which profession do you want to know about?
