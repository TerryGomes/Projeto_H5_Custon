!Head Blacksmith Bronk:

To qualify to become an Artisan, your level must be at least be 20 and you must pass the Test of the Artisan.

However, even if you earn these qualifications, I cannot change your profession. This is because only those who have experienced Human society and understand the great world beyond the Spine Mountains are qualified to change profession. A Dwarf must have a full understanding of the outside world's economy.

To take the Test of the Artisan, go to *Blacksmith Silvery*. She will give you detailed instructions. If you pass the test and earn your qualifications, go to the *town of Gludio* and meet *Head Blacksmith Tapoy* in the blacksmith's there. If you have met the qualifications, he will change your profession to Artisan.
