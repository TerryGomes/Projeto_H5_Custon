!To be an Elder, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Healer.

You have acquired the level but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting the Tokens and after more training. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation in to an Elder.Â
