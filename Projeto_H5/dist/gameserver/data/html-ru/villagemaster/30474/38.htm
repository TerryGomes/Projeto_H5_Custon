!To be an Abyss Walker, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Searcher.

But what is this, you level is not high enough and you haven't even collected all of the marks. Come back after collecting the marks and after more training. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation in to an Abyss Walker.Â
