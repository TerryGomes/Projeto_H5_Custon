!Congratulations! You have become an Abyss Walker of the proud Dark Elves at last. The life of an Abyss Walker might be strange for you now, but do not worry too much. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.

I hope you become a dignified Abyss Walker, who lives up to the name of Shilen. And try harder to become the best swordsman. Congratulations again on becoming a Abyss Walker!Â
