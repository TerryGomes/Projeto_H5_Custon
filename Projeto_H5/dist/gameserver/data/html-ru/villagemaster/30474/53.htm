!Congratulations! You have become an Phantom Summoner of the proud Dark Elves at last. The life of a Phantom Summoner may still feel strange, but you do not need to worry. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.

From now on do your best to become a dignified Shilien Oracle that increases the pride of the Dark Elves. I hope you will make the name of Shilen widely known in the world and cause everyone to tremble in fear.Â
