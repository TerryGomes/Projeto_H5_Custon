!Congratulations! You have become a Phantom Ranger of the proud Dark Elves at last. The life of a Phantom Ranger may still feel strange, but you do not need to worry. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.

I hope you become a dignified Phantom Ranger, who lives up to the name of Shilen. And try harder to become the best swordsman. Congratulations again on becoming a Phantom Ranger!Â
