!To be a Shillien Knight, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Fate and the Mark of Witchcraft.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I will change your occupation to a Shilien Knight.Â
