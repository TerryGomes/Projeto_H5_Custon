!To be an Abyss Walker, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Searcher.

You have acquired the level but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all of the marks. If you collect all of them and come to me I will change your occupation to an Abyss Walker.Â
