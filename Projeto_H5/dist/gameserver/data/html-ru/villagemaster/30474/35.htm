!To be a Shillien Elder, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Pilgrim, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Reformer.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I will change your occupation to a Shillien Elder.Â
