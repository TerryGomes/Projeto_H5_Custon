!To be an Abyss Walker, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Searcher.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I will change your occupation to an Abyss Walker.Â
