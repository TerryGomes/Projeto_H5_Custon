!Congratulations! At last, you have become a Shillien Knight of the proud Dark Elves. The life of a Shillien Knight may still feel strange but you do not need to worry. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.

In the future, I hope you become a proud Dark Elf with high dignity who glorifies the name of Shilen and magnificently destroys the arrogant Elves. Congratulations again on becoming a Shillien Knight!Â
