!Congratulations! You have become an Shillien Elder of the proud Dark Elves at last. The life of a Shillien Elder might be strange for you now, but there is nothing to worry about. Everything is going to be all right once you start learning from the Masters around you.

From now on do your best to become a dignified Shillien Elder that increases the pride of the Dark Elves. I hope you will make the name of Shilen widely known in the world and cause everyone to tremble in fear.Â
