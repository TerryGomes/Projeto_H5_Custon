!To be a Phantom Summoner, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Fate, and the Mark of the Summoner.

But what is this, you level is not high enough and you haven't even collected all of the marks. Come back after collecting the marks and after more training. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation in to a Phantom Summoner.Â
