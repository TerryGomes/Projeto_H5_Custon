!High Priest Sylvain:

You need the appropriate level and token to become a Human Wizard. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Wizard, you must have the token that proves you have passed the Test of the Human Wizard.

You have achieved a sufficient level, but it seems you have not yet passed the Test of the Human Wizard. You will be accepted as a true Wizard only when you have passed the test. *Parina*, who studies elemental magic at the temple in the *village of Gludin*, can tell you about the test in detail. You must attain the *bead of four seasons*, which she will give you when you have collected the tokens for all four elements.Â
