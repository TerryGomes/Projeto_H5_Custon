!High Priestess Levian:

To become a Cleric, one's faith must be verified. I always leave the judgement in this matter in the hands of *Priest Zigaunt*, who has devout faith. I suggest you speak to Priest Zigaunt here in our temple. To change profession to Cleric, you must pass his test and bring back the *mark of faith* as proof.
