!High Priestess Levian:

You need the appropriate level and token to become a Human Wizard. To change profession, your level must be at least 20, and to become a Human Wizard, you must have the token that proves you have passed the Test of the Human Wizard.%%
You have achieved a sufficient level, but it seems you have not yet passed the test. You will be accepted as a true Human Wizard only when you have passed the test. The Test of the Human Wizard requires gathering the tokens of the four elements. Visit *Parina* in our sanctuary to learn more about collecting the tokens. To change profession to become a Human Wizard, you should bring back the *bead of four seasons* which you will receive when you have all four tokens.Â
