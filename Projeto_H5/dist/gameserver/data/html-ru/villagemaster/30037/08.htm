!High Priestess Levian:

A change of profession occurs when someone with the required abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. A Human Mystic like yourself can change profession to become a *Human Wizard*, who practices Elemental Magic, or a *Cleric*, who seeks the will of the gods. Which profession do you wish to know about?
