!High Priestess Levian:

To change your profession to Human Wizard, you should bring back tokens for each of the four elements of water, fire, wind and earth -- for these form the basis of elemental magic. Visit *Parina*, who has long studied elemental magic, to learn how to collect the tokens. She is here in this temple, so you can meet her immediately. You will receive the *bead of four seasons* when you collect tokens for all four elements. If you bring me that, you can change profession to become a Human Wizard.
