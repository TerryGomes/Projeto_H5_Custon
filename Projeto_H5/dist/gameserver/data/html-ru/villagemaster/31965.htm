!Grand Master Hector:

It would give me great joy to test your ability and confirm your talent.

Actually, Schuttgart is not yet recognized as a place where warriors can hone their abilities, so Grand Masters like myself have had a difficult time developing our own skills.

Were more warriors to visit us, we would be able to assist them even as they assist us. Isn't that the best of both worlds?
