!Warehouse Chief Moke:

To qualify to become a Scavenger, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Scavenger.%%
Ask *Collector Pippi of the Dwarven village* about the Test of the Scavenger. She will tell you everything you need to know about the test, in detail. After you have passed the test, come to me. Then I will change your profession to a Scavenger.

Use a Gatekeeper to get to the Dwarven village.
