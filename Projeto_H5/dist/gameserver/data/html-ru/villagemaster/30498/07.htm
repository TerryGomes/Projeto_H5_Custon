!Warehouse Chief Moke:

To become a Scavenger, you must be at least level 20 and must pass the Test of the Scavenger.

I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not yet passed the Test of the Scavenger. Ask *Collector Pippi of the Dwarven village* about the test. She will tell you everything you need to know about it in detail. After you have passed the test, come to me. Then I will change your profession to a Scavenger.Â
