!Grand Master Oltlin:

You have left your village and have come a long way, young child of Shilen. How do you feel, now that you see the great castle and the ever-changing streets that are the pride of the Humans? Even though you would appreciate and admire them, do not be enticed by their allure. There is often a serpent's lair hidden beneath even the most beautiful bed of flowers. You too may one day face the hidden truth of this city...
