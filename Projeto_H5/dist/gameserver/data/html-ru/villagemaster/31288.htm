!High Prefect Aklan:

Welcome to Goddard, land of war and fire! In this place, blood boils as hot as the lava that flows from the volcanoes of the north!

Those disgusting Varka Silenos and Ketra Orc tribes intend to battle nearby, and it is said that the Fire Dragon Valakas has awakened from its long slumber. Soon it will be time for Pa'agrio's glorious warriors to arise, so don not be be lax with your preparations!
