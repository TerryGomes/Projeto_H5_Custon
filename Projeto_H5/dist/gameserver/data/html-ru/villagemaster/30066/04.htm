!Grand Master Pabris:

To become an Elven Knight, you must prove your ability. That has always been the job of *Master Sorius, who lives in the town of Gludio*. He has taught Elven Knights for a long time, and he give you the test appropriate for you. You should bring back the *Elven Knight brooch* which he will give you when you pass his test.
