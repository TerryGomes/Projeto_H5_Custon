!Grand Master Pabris:

To become a Warrior, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level should be at least 20 to be qualified to change profession. To become a Warrior, you need the *medallion of the Warrior* to prove that you passed the Test of the Warrior, as well as an appropriate level.

I am satisfied with your level, but it seems like you have not yet passed the Test of the Warrior. You will only be accepted as a true Warrior after you pass the test. Go ask *Master Aymus in the village of Gludin* about the Test of the Warrior.Â
