!High Prefect Osborn:

To obtain the qualifications to become an Orc Shaman, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Orc Shaman.

However, it seems that your level is not high enough, and you have not yet passed the Test of the Orc Shaman. First, work to raise your level to 20 or higher. To take the Test of the Orc Shaman, go to *Tataru Zu Hestui of the Orc village*. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession.

Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.Â
