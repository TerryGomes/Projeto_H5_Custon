!High Prefect Osborn:

To obtain the qualifications to become an Orc Shaman, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Orc Shaman.

I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Orc Shaman yet. To take the test, go to *Tataru Zu Hestui of the Orc village*. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession.%%
Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.Â
