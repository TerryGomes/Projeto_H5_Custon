!To be a Temple Knight, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Healer.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation in to a Temple Knight.Â
