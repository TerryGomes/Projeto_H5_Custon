!To be a Temple Knight, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Healer.

You have gained enough levels, but you still haven't brought me the marks. As I said when I was talking about occupations, bring me all the marks and come back to me. Then I shall change your occupation to a Temple Knight.Â
