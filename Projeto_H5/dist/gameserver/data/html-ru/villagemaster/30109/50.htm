!To be a Dark Avenger, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of Witchcraft. Your level is sufficient, but you did not bring me all of the marks.

To change to a Dark Avenger, you must bring all 3 marks I told you about when I was talking about occupations. Now, take the tests and bring me the marks.Â
