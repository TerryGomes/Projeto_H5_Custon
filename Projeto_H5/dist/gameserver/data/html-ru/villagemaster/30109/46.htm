!To be a Paladin, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of Duty, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Healer. Your level is already over 40 but you still do not have the marks.

To change to a Paladin, you have to bring all 3 marks I told you about when I was talking about occupations. Now, take the tests and bring me the marks.Â
