!To be a Plainswalker, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Searcher.

You have gained enough levels, but you still haven't brought me the marks. As I said when I was talking about occupations, bring me all the marks and come back to me. Then I shall change your occupation to a Plainswalker.Â
