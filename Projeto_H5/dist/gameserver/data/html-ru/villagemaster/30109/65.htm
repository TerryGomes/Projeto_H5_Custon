!To be a Silver Ranger, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Seeker, the Mark of Life, and the Mark of the Sagittarius.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation into a Silver Ranger.Â
