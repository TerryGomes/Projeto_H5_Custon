!Grand Master Xenos:

The *iron heart* is only given to those who pass the Test of the Assassin. *Triskel* is in charge of that test. He is a great Dark Elf, who has been an Assassin himself for a long time. He is always near the Dark Elven guild in the *town of Gludio*, so you will easily find him once you get there. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road to the east. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is much easier.
