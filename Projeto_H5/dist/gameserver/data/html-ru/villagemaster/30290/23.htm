!Grand Master Xenos:

To become a Dark Wizard, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You must also have a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Dark Wizard.

However, it seems your level is not high enough, and you have not passed the Test of the Dark Wizard, either. First, raise your level to 20 or higher. Also, to take the test, look for *Shamaness Varika* in the Dark Forest. To change profession, you must pass the test she gives and bring back the *jewel of darkness* as a token. She is staying at the *altar* of the Dark Forest. The altar is in the southern part of the forest. To reach the altar, take the road north. Then you will come to the Dark Forest. Enter the forest and go down the road until you come to a road that forks to the east. Take that road until you arrive at the altar.Â
