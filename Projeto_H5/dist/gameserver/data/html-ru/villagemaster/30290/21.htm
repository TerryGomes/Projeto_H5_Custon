!Grand Master Xenos:

To become an Assassin, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You also need a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Assassin.

I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Assassin. To become an Assassin, find *Triskel* and pass the test that he gives you, bringing back the *iron heart* as proof. He is always near the Dark Elven Guild in the *town of Gludio*, so you will easily find him nearby once you get there. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road towards the east.Â
