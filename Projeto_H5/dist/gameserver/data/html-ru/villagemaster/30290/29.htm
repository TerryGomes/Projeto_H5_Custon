!Grand Master Xenos:

To become a Shillien Oracle, the appropriate level and token are required. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. Also, a token that proves that you passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle is required.

I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle. To take the test, you should find *Sorceress Sidra* in the Dark Elven Guild of the *town of Gludio*. You can change profession to Shillien Oracle only if you pass her test and bring back the *orb of abyss* as a token. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road towards the east.Â
