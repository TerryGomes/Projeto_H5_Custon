!Grand Master Xenos:

To become a Palus Knight, you need the appropriate level and token. Your level must be at least 20 to qualify to change profession. You also need a token to prove you have passed the Test of the Palus Knight, as well.

I am satisfied with your level, but it seems that you have not passed the Test of the Palus Knight. Go to *Master Virgil* in the *town of Gludio* to take the test. You can change profession to a Palus Knight only after you take his test and bring back the *gaze of the abyss* as proof. You can get to the town of Gludio by following the road towards the east. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is faster.Â
