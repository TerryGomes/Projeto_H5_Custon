!Grand Master Xenos:

The *orb of abyss* is given only to those who have passed the Test of the Shillien Oracle. To take the Test of the Shillien Oracle, you should find *Sorceress Sidra* in the Dark Elven Guild of the *town of Gludio*. As you know, you can get to the town of Gludio by following the road towards the east. Of course, using a Gatekeeper is much easier.
