!Warehouse Chief Fisler:

Ha ha! Yah, I am pretty busy. Hey, Kincaid! Tell Hoffa to come see me soon!

So...are you an adventurer? What brings you to me? Is it work for the Dwarven Ambassador, the Warehouse Chief or the Isle of Souls Supply Distribution Manager?

Well, if you are an adventurer, you must have come for me, the Warehouse Chief. My time is valuable, so just get to the point!
