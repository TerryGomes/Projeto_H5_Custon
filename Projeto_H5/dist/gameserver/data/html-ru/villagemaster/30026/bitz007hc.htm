!Grand Master Bitz:

To become a Rogue, your level must be at least 20, and you must pass the Test of the Rogue. But as I told you, you cannot become a Rogue here. You must first go out into the world and improve your skills.

Therefore, you must go to *Gludio* to become a Rogue. There is a ship bound for the village of Gludin departing from the port southwest of the village. Sail to *the village of Gludin* and find *Grand Master Ramos*. He will help you. You will be able to change profession after you pass the Test of the Rogue which he will give you.
