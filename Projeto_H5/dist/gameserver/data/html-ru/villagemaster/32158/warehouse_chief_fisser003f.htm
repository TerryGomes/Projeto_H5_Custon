Warehouse Chief Fisler:<br>A class transfer occurs when someone with the necessary abilities and experience is promoted to a more advanced profession. You cannot complete a class transfer here, unfortunately, but I can give you the information you need. If you are a Dwarven Fighter, you can transfer to a <font color="LEVEL">Scavenger</font> or an <font color="LEVEL">Artisan</font>. Which one would you like to know more about?<br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link villagemaster/32158/warehouse_chief_fisser006fa.htm">Scavenger.</a><br><a action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Link villagemaster/32158/warehouse_chief_fisser006fb.htm">Artisan.</a></body></html>
