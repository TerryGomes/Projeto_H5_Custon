!To be a Warlock, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Summoner.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back after you have trained more. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation to a Warlock.Â
