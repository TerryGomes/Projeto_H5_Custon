!To be a Sorcerer, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Scholar, the Mark of Trust, and the Mark of the Magus.

You have acquired the level but you still haven't brought me all of the marks. Come back after collecting all marks and after more training. If you fulfill these obligations I will change your occupation to a Sorcerer.Â
