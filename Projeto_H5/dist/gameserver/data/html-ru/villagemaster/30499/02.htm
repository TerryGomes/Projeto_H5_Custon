!Head Blacksmith Tapoy:

The fundamental characteristics of Scavengers and *Artisans* are that the Scavenger collects rare materials and the Artisan makes something valuable from those materials. In combat, Artisans use the golems that they make instead of risking their own bodies. They can actually produce items during combat, and therefore are invaluable during battles.

Among Artisans, the best are selected to be *Warsmiths*. Warsmith is an exalted profession with manufacturing skills of the highest level -- they can even make siege golems.
