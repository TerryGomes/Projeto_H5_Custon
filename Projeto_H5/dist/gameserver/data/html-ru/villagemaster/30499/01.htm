!Head Blacksmith Tapoy:

To change profession means that you have attained a certain degree of ability and experience, and may be promoted to a higher-level profession. I can give you information about the professions. If you are a Dwarven Fighter, you can change profession to become an *Artisan* or *Scavenger*. Which profession do you want to know about?
