!To be a Bounty Hunter, your level must be over 40 and you need to collect the Mark of the Guildsman, the Mark of Prosperity, and the Mark of the Searcher.

You did collect all of the marks, but your level is not high enough. Come back to me after more training. Then I shall change your occupation to a Bounty Hunter. Keep up the good work, young one.Â
