!Grand Master Javier:

Pleased to met you. I am Grand Magister Javier. Ah, is my voice too loud? Sorry! Whenever I see young, promising warriors like you, my excitement just gets the better of me!

Ha ha! Hmm, I see you wondering, "Is this Grand Magister really on the level?" Don't worry -- I am! But I still love to chat with young warriors who are journeying through different territories.

Never fear, though -- I take my job seriously.
