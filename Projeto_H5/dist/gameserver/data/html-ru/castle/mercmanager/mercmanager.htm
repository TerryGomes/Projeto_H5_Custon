Greetings, my Lord. Would you care to hire the mercenaries of our guild?

Although you have already signed a Contract with special mercenaries who were after the Seal of Strife previously, you will not be able to place them unless they belong to our guild.

If you don't know how to draw up a Contract, just ask me.
