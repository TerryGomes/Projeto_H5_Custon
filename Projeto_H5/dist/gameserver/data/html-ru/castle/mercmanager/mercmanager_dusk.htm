Currently, due to the influence of the seal of strife, I regret to say that it has become difficult to mobilize our guild members.

You can still hire *Deadmen of War*. Although you possess a posting ticket from a previous Contract, if it does not meet the conditions of the seal, you won't be able to place it.

Although the situation appears dire, trust in your soldiers and be brave until the end.

If you don't know how to draw up a Contract, just ask me.
