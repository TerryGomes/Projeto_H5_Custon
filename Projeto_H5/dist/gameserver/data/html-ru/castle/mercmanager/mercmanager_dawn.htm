Greetings, my lord! Do you wish to hire the mercenaries of our guild?

Along with our highly skilled mercenaries, the *Lords of Dawn<* will join forces with us. The *Mercenaries of Legend* will also join in. The balance of power is tilted in our favor!

The seal of strife is on our side! Victory is assured!

If you don't know how to draw up a Contract, just ask me.
