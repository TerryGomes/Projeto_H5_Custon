You will receive a certificate for each mercenary you hire. Place each certificate in the location you wish to deploy a mercenary. When a battle commences, a mercenary will be summoned to a place that is in line with the location and point-of-view of the character who placed the certificate. Your mercenaries will fight with everything they have to protect your life, my Lord!

Mercenaries may be re-deployed by simply moving the certificates.

There is a limit to the number of mercenaries that can be deployed, and it is possible to buy more certificates than needed.

Mercenaries may only be deployed inside their castle of origin and must not be placed too closely together. All Contracts are only valid for the duration of a single siege.
