Depending on its type, you may be able to evolve your pet. Evoliution is only possible when the pet is summoned. Also, since the process transfers the experience value, evolving a high level pet might actually result in a decrease in the pet's level.
Any items in the pet's inventory will be transferred to the owner's inventory.
