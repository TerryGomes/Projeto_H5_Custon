!Pet Manager Annette:

People too easily ignore the benefits Striders have provided to civilization. Think about it! Because of Striders, battle tactics for siege warfares and large-scale clan wars have changed dramatically. And transportation of goods between towns has become easier,  helping accelerate the flow of trade.
Perhaps I should write a book, eh? "The Impact of Striders on History of the Continent." How's that for a title, eh?
