Are you one of the soldiers from Aden? You deserve a reward simply for coming such a long way to help us.<br>
Unfortunately, things are happening very quickly here, and I'm afraid I don't have the luxury for long conversations.<br>
Even as we speak, monsters unlike any we've ever seen or heard of are wreaking havoc on my people. They seem to be filled with insane hatred toward all humanoids.<br>
But if you have the <font color="LEVEL"> will and skill to fight them</font>, even these enemies can be defeated. I ask for nothing else. Nothing is more fearsome than a mighty warrior fighting in a righteous cause.<br>
To arms! When you're ready to fight, come see me again.
