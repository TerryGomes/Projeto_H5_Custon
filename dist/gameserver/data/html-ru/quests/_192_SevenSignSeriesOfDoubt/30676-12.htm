Ach! If everyone was as warm-hearted as you, I'd not need contractors, eh? I'd just ask people wandering by to help, and keep my coin in my pocket.<br>
But I'm no leech, y'hear. I'll pay your way fair and square, and I'll nae hear a peep of protest from you. I'll make sure it's waiting for you in the <font color="LEVEL">Temple of Einhasad</font> by the time you get to <font color="LEVEL">High Priest Hollint</font>.<br>
Take this letter, and get going now. I've a body to bring home.
