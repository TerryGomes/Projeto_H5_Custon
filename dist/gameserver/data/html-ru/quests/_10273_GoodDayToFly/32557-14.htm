How did it go? Ah, I was right about you. I knew you would succeed! (Ah, this one will be very useful to us...)<br>
Huh? What's that? Oh, it's nothing -- just talking to myself. Very well, let me write out your certificate.<br>
(He writes something on a paper.)<br>
With this, nobody will question your right to fly.<br>
I will also give you a spellbook that describes how to transform into your choice of Aurabird. Use it and I think you'll be able to fly in the Gracian skies without any help from me.<br>
Good luck!
