Item Broker Adventure Guildsman:

We will sell the items, many of them precious or hard-to-find, only at the time of the auction, which will be announced in advance.

Once items are registered, they will be auctioned off to the highest bidder.

All non-winning bidders will receive a refund in the exact amount of the money they unsucessfully bid on an item. The highest bidder will receive the item (at the cost specified).

Ah...you were outbid. Please note your refund and proceed with your next bid. If there is a passed-in price, the auction will stop.

After the auction ends, the highest bidder can obtain his or her new items at the warehouse.

If the passed-in ammount is not redeemed within one week, we will keep the amount. A long-term deposit is impossible due to the large number of customers.

Remember: items are non-returnable, so make your selections carefully!
