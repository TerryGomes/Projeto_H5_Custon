!Grand Master Aldenia:

Welcome to the Human Embassy. I am the ambassador, Grand Master Aldenia.

Following the summit in Giran it was agreed that each race would send a representative here to facilitate cooperation in the fight against the forces of evil. I am sorry to say, however, that we Humans are often distracted by internal squabbles over territory, religion and power. Forging an alliance with other races can be very difficult.

Especially when some meddlers like the High Priest at Einhasad over there walk around like they are ambassadors as wall... Short-sighted buffoon, promoting the interests of certain temples only... Aye... I'm sorry; please pay no attention to complaints -- I'm simply tried.

How may I help you?
