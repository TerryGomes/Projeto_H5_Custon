!Leopold:

Nice to meet you, traveler. I am Leopold, commander of the third platoon of the Black Lion mercenaries. Our troops are as dignified and courageous as any Knights on this continent. We, the Black Lions, were the ones who defended the Castle of Giran when the drakes flooded Dragon Valley last summer. And we were the ones to destroy the Abellan pirates during the attack of Heine, the Floating City.

Currently, we have been hired by the lord of Gludio to drive away the remaining troops of Gracia. We must not mistake them for frightened fugitive soldiers. We are dealing with an infamous *foreign troop ol mahum*, that is known for their cruelty and plundering.
