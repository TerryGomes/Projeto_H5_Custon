!Tetrarch Vellior:

Enlightenment is followed by sacrifice. If youlook back on the history of our race, you willtruly relize the truth of this teaching. Whenthe  * Great Sorcerer Dasparion* came to us athousand years ago and proposed to teach usblack magic, we did not anticipate the sacrificewe would have to pay in the future andaccepted his proposal.

When we were at war the Elves of thelight, the black magic spells we cast wiped outthe innocent Elves of the trees, due toDasparion's malicous plots. While the Elves ofthe trees died, they cursed us with all teirremaining strength. As a result, our beautifulforest withered, our skin became scorched bythe sun, we went blind and became therace of the Dark. For hundreds of years, welived hidden underground.

Now the curse of the Dark EDlves has beenbroken and we live above the ground, but wemust not forget the high price we paid to earnstrength.
