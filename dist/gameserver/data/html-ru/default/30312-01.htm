!Lighthouse Keeper Rocksewll:

Long ago, they say they sacrificed virgins tothe sea, but times have changed and there isno sailor who keeps this tradition. Instead, weset afloat a boat that contains a doll in theshape of a Human maiden. Now we have tomake that doll.

I've asked Warehouse Keeper Rolfe, who ishandy with his hands, to make the doll, but westill have to make the dolls long hair. For that, Ineed high quality fur yarn.

Hunt the keltris on the island and gather aboutten bundles of fur, then take them to Cristle inthe next village. You can find her at the well infront of the village warehouse. Give the fur toCristal, and she will spin it into yarn. Take theyarn and give it to Warehouse Keeper Rolfe. Hewill probably finish the doll on the spot. Assoon as the doll is finished, bring it back to me.I will give you a generous reward for your labor.
