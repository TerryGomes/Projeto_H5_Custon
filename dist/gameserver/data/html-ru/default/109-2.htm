!Jack Sage:


The Memories of a Newbie for summons provides the "Newbie Support buffs", which can be received up to level 75, to the veteran adventurer's summons of level 76 or more.

This is an additional gift given by the Temple, so that all of you can focus on training. This is a small reward to all the great adventurers who fought on the front lines when our world was in danger. Please note that it will only be available *during the time I'm dispatched*.


Your summon will receive the following buffs (these buffs do not apply to pets):

Wind Walk, Shield, Magic Barrier, Bless the Body, Bless the Soul, Vampiric Rage, Acumen, Regeneration, Concentration, Haste, and Empower.
