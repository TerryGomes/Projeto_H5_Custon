I an Tetrarch Vellior of the Dark Elves, heir ofthe dark truth of teh sacred book Icarus, envoyto teh other world, and highest Mystic to weildblack magic in the place of Hierarch Mitraell,who is now sealed away.

 *Black magic* is the source of our power and therevelation of dark truth, It is forbidden amongother races. They do not understand darknessand fear it, so therefore they exclude it.However, if there is light, there is shadow, andwe can control the true power of black magicbecause we confront darkness with no fear.
