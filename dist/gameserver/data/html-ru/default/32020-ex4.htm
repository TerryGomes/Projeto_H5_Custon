Rafforty:

Is this a Freya Necklace?  Hmm... it's okay I guess.  It isn't as interesting as a Blessed Freya Necklace.  You could be lucky enough to get one, or if you happen to aquire Freya's Soul in a bottle you can create a Blessed Freya Necklace.  However the process is, well... different.  Tell you what, if you bring me these items I can make one for you.
