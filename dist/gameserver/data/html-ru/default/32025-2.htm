<html><body>Clan Trader Ilia:<br>
There are many ways to increase your clan's reputation, from capturing a castle or fortress in battle, to helping our wandering newbies. Protection a territory is also laudable, and in that spirit I wish to make you an offer if you can bring me these items:<br>
<font color="LEVEL">1 Blood Alliance</font> to prove that you have successfully defended a castle, <font color="LEVEL">10 Blood Oaths gained by preserving civic order in a territory</font>, and finally <font color="LEVEL">100 Knight's Epaulettes to prove that you are invincible in battle</font>.<br>
Bring me these things, and I will personally see to it that your reputation increases.<br>
