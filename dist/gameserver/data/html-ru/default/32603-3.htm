!Officer Tepios:

This entire area acts almost like a living organism.

Just as blood supplies nutrients to a human body, so apparently do the souls who have perished here supply energy for the *Tumors of Death and the Soul Coffins*.

They in turn use that energy to strengthen nearby monsters or disadvantage attacking adventurers. Destroy those things whenever you encounter them. Of course, that's easier said than done -- the nearby monsters will defend it fiercely.

But if you're able to destroy a Tumor, you will gain an advantage over the monsters. We don't know for sure, but we think that the newly-freed souls help us. It is possible to communicate with a *Destroyed Tumor*, and you can also use it to teleport to other Tumors, although you'll need something called *Tears of a Freed Soul* to do so.
