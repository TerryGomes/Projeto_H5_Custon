Jeffrey is an outstanding chef as well as an excellent businessman!

A food delivery service! What a great idea!

Deliver delicious food quickly to customers so they need not risk being attacked by dangerous beasts! Isn't that an awesome idea?

I think I might start a business like that when I get home!
