!Mouth of Ekimus:

There is a narrow path among the decomposed flesh and frayed yellow bones. It is surrounded by the feel of death and the stench of decay.

It seems that you must pass through the gap to secretly enter one of many *halls* of the Seed of Infinity inside.

[npc_%objectId%_Chat 1|Pass through the gap and into the Hall of Suffering.]
