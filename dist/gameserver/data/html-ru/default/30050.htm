!Elias:

Do you happen to know anything about medicine or *herbs*? I'm desperately in need of help, but I can't find anyone with the knowledge I need in an out-of-the-way village like this.

Please, if you know anyone with this knowledge, send them to me. I'm willing to pay -- I'll give everything I have, if I must. If I can't find someone to help me, my whole life will be ruined!
