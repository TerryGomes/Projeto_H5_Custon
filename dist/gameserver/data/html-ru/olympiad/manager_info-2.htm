Grand Olympiad Manager: 
<br>The Olympiad match can be generally divided by three types. One is a 3 vs. 3 Team Match where 3 people become a team to compete with other teams, one is a 1 vs. 1 Match where 1:1 competition is held regardless of the class, one is a 1 vs. 1 Class Match where a person can compete with an opponent with the same class as his.
<br>To become a hero through Grand Olympiad, you have to win many Grand Olympiad matches. Winning goes to a team/an individual who inflicted the most damage to their opponent(s) in the Olympiad matches. Damage to a servitor of summoner, Golem of Maestro, or Dark Panther of Hell Knight will by no means affect the winning. The team with the ‘most survived members’ will win at a team match.
<br>The winner of a Grand Olympiad match will take Olympiad points from the loser of the match. In order to calculate the amount of points that will be won/lost at the end of the match, the total points from both participants are compared at the beginning of the match. The lowest amount between the two is used as a starting amount. The winner will take 1/5th of the loser’s points based on the lowest Olympiad amount.
<br>As an example, if one participant has 60 Olympiad points and the other participant has 40 Olympiad points, the amount of points that can be won/lost would be based on the 40 Olympiad points, as that is the lowest amount. The winner of the match would receive1/5th of 40 Olympiad points and the loser would lose 1/5th of 40 Olympiad points.
<br>The maximum amount of points that can be won/lost at the end of a match cannot exceed 10. In situations where both participants start a match with 50 or more points, neither combatant will lose more than 10 points.
<br>With a team match, 3 people will make up a team and only the party leader can apply for a match. All party members should have over 2 Olympiad points in order to register for a team match. Addition/subtraction of points upon winning/losing will be calculated by adding every team members’ points, and the loser’s points will be partially subtracted.
<br>Appreciable amounts of Olympiad points will be given when the cycle of Olympiad starts and a small amount of points will be added at regular intervals. You can participate in an Olympiad match with at least 1 Olympiad point but you are no longer participate in Grand Olympiad when point is 0.
