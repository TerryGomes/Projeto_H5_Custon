!Tetrarch Kaitar:

Shilen, Mother of the Abyss, is the Goddesswho controls fate and death. Shilen permits alllife to be limited, and it is she who enablesdeath, so that all livingthing can return totheir original state of nothingness. Other racesdo not understand the eternal cycle of birthand death. They only see one side of death,and fear and hate Shilen.

Beacuse of these prejudices, in the HumanKingdom, the mark of Shilen hanging aroundone's neck will lead to being burnt at the stakefor heresy. In  spite of this persecution, thereare secret groups of Humans who follow theGoddess Shilen. In a sense, their faith is thesame as the Dark Elves. If only we could knowwho they were.
