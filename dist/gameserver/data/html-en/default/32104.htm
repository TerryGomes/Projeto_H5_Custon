!Vervato:

I am Vervato! It is my sacred task to cheat and revive fallen comrades whose spirits are ready to depart for the dark nether regions.

My magic is more powerful than even that of the sorcerers of the Elroki tribe; I am the greatest corpse summoner of them all!

But remember that summoning a corpse is only possible if there is a corpse... and, of course, the requisite fee.
