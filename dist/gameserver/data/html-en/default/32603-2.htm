!Officer Tepios:

The status of the Seed of Immortality constantly changes because of the success or failure of the adventurers within its area. One cycle can be divided into a total of 5 steps. Sometimes we seek to block its power by attacking before the power of the Seed becomes too strong, but sometimes we must defend efficiently when its power weakens. And if this region becomes stable, you can collect items which can't be acquired at ordinary times.

Information like this is considered very important, so it is always delivered to Kucereus' Alliance Base. Admiral Kucereus and General Dilios must be aware of any changes as soon as possible! You can find about which cycle we are in through them.

Don't forget! All of your actions affect the cycle of this region. Be mindful of that!
