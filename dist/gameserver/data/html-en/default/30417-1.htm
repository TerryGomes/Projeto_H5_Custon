!Sir Klaus Vasper:

In Castle Aden, the capitol of the kingdom, hundreds of knights serve the king, but there are only three members of the Knight Guild in Gludio including myself.

Sir Collin Windawood, keeper of the sword of ritual, has been dispatched to serve as the governor of Talking Island, and Sir Aaron Tanford has left on a journey to his homelands for private reasons. So I am left alone here.
