!Event Manager Roy the Cat:

*1 - Medals and Prizes*

Hunting the monsters that dwell outside the village will yield medals. Bring them to me and I'll reward you with a fabulous prize, personally selected for you by Collector Bashtal! You'll find two types of medals: Regular medals and glittering medals. Glittering medals are quite rare, and therefore most valuable, especially for your future.

*2 - Advancing Levels*

A collector's level reflects that player's contribution to the medal collection and collecting skill. Meow! Higher levels are eligible for a greater selection of prizes. Winnie over there can tell you more about raising your level.
