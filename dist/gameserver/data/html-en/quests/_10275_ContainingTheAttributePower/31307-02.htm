Do you know <font color="LEVEL">Attribute Master Yang</font> here in Rune Township? He is one of our regulars. His research keeps him very busy. Of course, his constant need for ingredients also makes him one of our best customers.<br>But I rarely see him lately. Our sales have dropped, and his absence isn't helping.<br>The last time I saw him, he mentioned some problem she was facing, a problem he said could be resolved by a capable adventurer... I hope that happens quickly -- we need his business! But alas, I don't know how to find respectable adventurer in these parts...<br>
Do you know of one who might be willing to help us?
