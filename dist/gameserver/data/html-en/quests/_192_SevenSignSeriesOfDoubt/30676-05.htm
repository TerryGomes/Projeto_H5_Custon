Ach. Look, I'm not saying you'll find Jacob face down in a ditch. I just want the boy found. If he's poured my money down his throat again then... well... he'll see.<br>
I've found out some bits of information too. Seems <font color="LEVEL">Hector</font> knows something about this killer, though if he's able to pull fact from fiction then he's got more knocking about that skull of his than most.<br>
Take this letter, and go and find him at <font color="LEVEL">Oren's Northern entrance</font>. With luck he'll set your path straight and lead you to m'cousin.
