Ah! Are these the <font color="LEVEL">cellular tissues of Blade Otis and Weird Bunei</font>?<br>
From their pristine appearance, I can tell you were very careful. I couldn't have done better myself. Well done!<br>
Now take these samples to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Minevia</font> at the Temple of Einhasad. He will be very pleased.<br>
If we can determine the nature of the mutated Kaneus, your efforts will not be forgotten! But there is no time to waste, so hurry and take these samples to <font color="LEVEL">Magister Minevia</font> before they deteriorate!
