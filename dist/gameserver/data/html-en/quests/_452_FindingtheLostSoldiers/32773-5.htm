Officer Jakan:

Ah, you're back and in one piece. I see� though this soldier didn't make it alive, at least we know his name now.

If it weren't for you, the names of the dead for the sake of Gracia would not be remembered. Thanks to you, he'll receive the eternal rest he deserves and his family will be able to find some peace in this tragedy. We remain eternally grateful of you.
