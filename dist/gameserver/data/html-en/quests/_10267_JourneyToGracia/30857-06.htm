<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
I appreciate your commitment. All of Aden will be counting on you and your comrades.<br>
Your first challenge will be reaching Gracia. First, go to the <font color="LEVEL">Aden Airship Dock</font>. There you should ask the manager, <font color="LEVEL">Magister Papiku</font>, about the details of the journey.<br>
Take this. It is a letter to <font color="LEVEL">Keucereus</font>, who currently rules Gracia. It designates you as one of the Aden warriors sent to fight the evil in his land. I pray you will be able to help him...and us. May Einhasad shine her blessed light upon your path...
