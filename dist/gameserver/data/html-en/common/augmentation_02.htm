<br>You wish to remove the refined Life Stone? That's fine. But understand that this smelting method offers both improvement and potential penalties.

It is difficult to restore the original weapon when removing the Life Stone. It requires a special chemical process and a special tool. It's also expensive.

With that in mind, would you still like to remove the Life Stone from the refined weapon?
